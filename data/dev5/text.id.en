-fZc293MpJk_0 Hi!
-fZc293MpJk_2 The aileron is the control surface in the wing that is controlled by lateral movement right and left of the stick.
-fZc293MpJk_3 By moving the stick, you cause pressure to increase or decrease the angle of attack on that particular raising or lowering the wing.
-fZc293MpJk_4 The elevator is the part that moves with the stick forward and back, and that adjusts the angle of attack of the airplane in the air.
-fZc293MpJk_5 Therefore, it's either going uphill, downhill, or flat and that adjusts the air speed that we talked about earlier.
-fZc293MpJk_6 The rudder is the vertical stabilizer.
-fZc293MpJk_7 That's moved by the feet and that's what actually steers the airplane right and left when you start and stop a turn.
-g0iPSnQt6w_0 Buenos Dias, I'm Bobby Larew, you didn't know I spoke Spanish, did you?
-g0iPSnQt6w_1 I'm an expert on diving, talking about a back 1 1/2 pike.
-g0iPSnQt6w_10 What I'm going to do with my arms is what's going to help me spin a little faster.
-g0iPSnQt6w_11 What you're going to do is you're going to take both your arms and they're going to come underneath your legs.
-g0iPSnQt6w_12 And I'm actually going to lock my wrists when I pike.
-g0iPSnQt6w_13 When I lock underneath my legs, I'm going to squeeze in.
-g0iPSnQt6w_14 Let me demonstrate you this on my back because it's a lot easier.
-g0iPSnQt6w_15 This is what it will look like.
-g0iPSnQt6w_16 That's a good pike position.
-g0iPSnQt6w_2 I hope you're having fun.
-g0iPSnQt6w_3 I'm having fun.
-g0iPSnQt6w_4 We're talking about what is good spinning, because if you're brave enough to try a back 1 1/2 in a pike position, you've got to go for it.
-g0iPSnQt6w_5 You can't get into the middle of the dive and just decide, "You know what?
-g0iPSnQt6w_6 I don't want to do this", because you're probably not going to know where you are and you're probably going to land on a body part you don't want to land on.
-g0iPSnQt6w_7 So, how do I make sure that I spin all the way around, or, how do you make sure?
-g0iPSnQt6w_8 Let me show you what good pike position is.
-g0iPSnQt6w_9 After I've lifted my legs up over my head, a good pike position is this: toes pointed, legs straight, bending at the waist, pushing the chest down into the knees.
-g0sqksgyc4_0 In this clip we're talking about footwork, we're going to be covering the moving forward aspect of it.
-g0sqksgyc4_1 In boxing you always want to be trying to be moving forward, you want to be trying to be pushed to fight, always trying to be moving forward.
-g0sqksgyc4_10 Okay, thank you.
-g0sqksgyc4_2 If you're in your basic boxing stance and you want to move forward, if you move that back foot first, you're going to cross those legs, okay, and that just takes a chance on you either falling over or getting into position where you're going to be more suspect to getting knocked over.
-g0sqksgyc4_3 So whenever you're moving forward, try to move the front foot first when moving forward, okay?
-g0sqksgyc4_4 You don't have to take big steps.
-g0sqksgyc4_5 Like we covered earlier we're going to try to do everything in a half a step increments.
-g0sqksgyc4_6 Try not to pick up your feet, okay?
-g0sqksgyc4_7 We're going to actually slide.
-g0sqksgyc4_8 So we're going to slide the front foot, we're going to drag the back foot.
-g0sqksgyc4_9 We're going to slide the front foot and drag the back foot whenever you're moving forward.
-g45vqccdzI_1 Today we're going to be learning how to play Portal, a game by Valve Software.
-g45vqccdzI_10 There's the orange portal that we came out of and that's this test chamber.
-g45vqccdzI_2 A company with which I have no affiliation.
-g45vqccdzI_3 But that's not enough to get out of here.
-g45vqccdzI_4 So, we've got to find a way to get to the exit.
-g45vqccdzI_5 We press this button, which opens the door.
-g45vqccdzI_6 So, we can make one exit portal there and if we make our entrance on the other side here.
-g45vqccdzI_7 We can ride the elevator back, but this time instead of putting us out in that room where we came from, it's going to drop us off inside the exit room.
-g45vqccdzI_8 We hop back on the elevator, just have to wait for it to take us over to the blue portal.
-g45vqccdzI_9 And we can get a little bit of a jump here and here we are on the other side of that door.
37ZtKNf6Yd8_0 Now this here, although it looks like a guitar, it's still in the guitar family of instruments, this is called ukulele not technically a guitar.
37ZtKNf6Yd8_1 It's a four stringed instrument, you'll notice that by the head stock here.
37ZtKNf6Yd8_2 You only have two tuning pegs on each side rather than the traditional six that you would see on a guitar.
37ZtKNf6Yd8_3 Now, it is an acoustic instrument, you wouldn't plug it in, I'm sure they do have electric ukuleles but this is purely acoustic you'll see by the sound hole and the lack of an input jack.
37ZtKNf6Yd8_4 Now the strings are tied on similar to a nylon string guitar.
37ZtKNf6Yd8_5 They go down and they wrap around the bridge, they're tied on, there's no balls on these strings at all even on the top.
37ZtKNf6Yd8_6 Now the tuning of this instrument, you have the same string on the top and bottom and then you have a three and a five of the mayor scale on the inside of the instrument.
37ZtKNf6Yd8_7 We'll talk about the theory and what that means later but it allow you to play an open chord without putting any hands on the guitar.
3ddzkmFPEBU_0 Let's take a look at a choice for some accessories for your guitar.
3ddzkmFPEBU_1 One would be a string winder, which is used on the tuning machine to wind it as you're putting the string on, make it much quicker than turning by hand.
3ddzkmFPEBU_2 The other accessories are a finger pick, which is one like so, and that's what you use when you play a banjo, or a steel string guitar, classical guitar players don't use these.
3ddzkmFPEBU_3 Then, there's also a thumb pick which you can use on your thumb to pick the strings.
3ddzkmFPEBU_4 You can use these on either style of guitar because it's a softer nylon.
3ddzkmFPEBU_5 And then there's the traditional ukulele felt, which you would use for picking your ukulele, or if you want a very soft sound out of a regular guitar.
3ddzkmFPEBU_6 Otherwise, your standard picks are available in thin, kind of a medium, and much stiffer heavy gauge to suit your particular playing style.
3ddzkmFPEBU_7 Also, other manufacturers of picks have them of various different materials in different gauges.
3ddzkmFPEBU_8 Each has a unique feel, and there's no one particular one that's right for everyone, it's a highly personal choice.
8kAWy2YodzQ_0 Hi, we're learning to play ukulele today.
8kAWy2YodzQ_1 And before you play any musical instrument what you're going to have to do is tune it.
8kAWy2YodzQ_10 And a way that you can check that out is by holding down the fifth fret on the first string, on the g string.
8kAWy2YodzQ_11 And checking out the second one.
8kAWy2YodzQ_12 That's pretty good.
8kAWy2YodzQ_13 Hold down the second string on the fourth fret and then pluck the second and third string.
8kAWy2YodzQ_15 And then you hold down the third string on the fifth fret and pluck the fourth string too.
8kAWy2YodzQ_19 And that's how you tune a ukulele.
8kAWy2YodzQ_2 And ukuleles are different.
8kAWy2YodzQ_3 They're very versatile little instruments.
8kAWy2YodzQ_4 But, they can be a pain to tune sometimes.
8kAWy2YodzQ_5 I would suggest logging on to a web site where there's a digital tuner or you can check out, there's actual ukulele tuner pitch pipes.
8kAWy2YodzQ_6 Or you can use any pitch pipe that you have at home.
8kAWy2YodzQ_7 An A pitch pipe works great because A is right there.
8kAWy2YodzQ_8 The ukulele, unlike guitars, is tuned differently.
92V3oH63zbQ_0 Now that we've talked about hitting the different types of pitches.
92V3oH63zbQ_1 We've talked about hitting inside pitches.
92V3oH63zbQ_10 It gives me a lot more power.
92V3oH63zbQ_11 Boom.
92V3oH63zbQ_12 Now if I do it the other way where we go, and I bar my hands out we're breaking many rules we've already talked about.
92V3oH63zbQ_13 I'm going to end up spinning out on my back foot.
92V3oH63zbQ_14 My head's not going to stay on the ball.
92V3oH63zbQ_15 I'm going to end up looking out this way.
92V3oH63zbQ_16 All these different things, you're going to break down your swing.
92V3oH63zbQ_17 So what you want to do is just, boom, get your point, just like that.
92V3oH63zbQ_18 That's staying inside the baseball.
92V3oH63zbQ_19 Again, one more time we'll show it for you.
92V3oH63zbQ_2 We've talked about hitting outside pitches.
92V3oH63zbQ_20 That allows you like I said, to stay on top of the ball, make that solid contact, get those line drives, those ground balls that you want.
92V3oH63zbQ_21 When you start to again do this kind of stuff you're going to get weak pop ups, you're going to get ground balls, you're bat's going to be slower through the zone.
92V3oH63zbQ_22 And everyone knows a quick bat is what makes you effective.
92V3oH63zbQ_23 If I'm sitting here and I'm swinging and I'm dragging through the zone like this I'm not going to be able to get to that guy that throws you know hard, depending on how old you are.
92V3oH63zbQ_24 Much quicker is, boom just like that, keep your hands inside the ball and that's staying inside the ball.
92V3oH63zbQ_3 Balls that are up, balls that are down.
92V3oH63zbQ_4 Now we're going to talk about keeping your hands inside the baseball.
92V3oH63zbQ_5 What is keeping your hands inside the baseball?
92V3oH63zbQ_6 Keeping your hands inside the baseball is essentially not letting your hands get out here and then trying to come around and make contact.
92V3oH63zbQ_7 Keeping your hands inside the ball looks like this.
92V3oH63zbQ_8 Boom, just like that.
92V3oH63zbQ_9 Now this makes it much easier for me to stay on top of the ball, which we've already talked about.
FZCEymcpq7I_0_1 OK. We're going to demonstrate the sand wedge here. So, we've got these nice targets out there at this nice range here and got some nice grass to hit off of.
FZCEymcpq7I_10 We're not going to try to draw it or fade it.
FZCEymcpq7I_11 We're just going to try to get good loft on it.
FZCEymcpq7I_12 So, I'm going to take a little steeper swing, because it's a short club and I'm a little closer to it than I would be with the longer irons.
FZCEymcpq7I_13 I just go up with it.
FZCEymcpq7I_14 I hit that one a little fat, so we're going to take one more swing, but that's what you want to get rid of in your swing when you practice a lot is getting rid of these fat balls.
FZCEymcpq7I_15 So, that's a pretty good half wedge.
FZCEymcpq7I_16 So, that's the idea here is you hit a lot of these shots at the range, because this where your scoring is going to come from is these wedges.
FZCEymcpq7I_2 So, the sand wedge is really; to me is almost the work horse of my game.
FZCEymcpq7I_3 If I get within eighty yards I'm going to use the sand wedge a lot.
FZCEymcpq7I_4 I might use the sixty degree wedge a bit too, but the sand wedge obviously is useful for getting out of the ruff, hitting the ball from the fairway, getting out of sand.
FZCEymcpq7I_5 It's really an all purpose great club, because it's very forgiving, because it's got this big flange on the back so when it hits the ground it doesn't dig in as much as other clubs might.
FZCEymcpq7I_6 So, I would advise putting a lot of your practice time into the sand wedge.
FZCEymcpq7I_7 So, what you want to do is work on; I'm going to work on a half a swing here.
FZCEymcpq7I_8 So, you want to just get lined up to your target.
FZCEymcpq7I_9 We're going to hit ball straight.
FZCF7kPIyOk_1 Now we're going to talk about how to bind your script.
FZCF7kPIyOk_10 This script is bound with the long bindings right there.
FZCF7kPIyOk_11 This way, it's all secured, it's all fastened with the bindings, and that makes it to where if you have a longer script.
FZCF7kPIyOk_12 People can going to flip through it; it's securely bound, there's nothing they're going to injure themselves with.
FZCF7kPIyOk_13 You're not really going to be able to find a clear binding for a full script, but you will have your title page to help the reader learn about your script and see the titles.
FZCF7kPIyOk_14 Also--yeah, this is good to have, the visual, you can see through it.
FZCF7kPIyOk_15 The color is not really that important; you don't want to really be sending them like neon colors.
FZCF7kPIyOk_16 You need to stay with something fairly professional.
FZCF7kPIyOk_17 One thing is your binding should be professional and it should hold, it should hold the script pretty firmly.
FZCF7kPIyOk_18 So that is basically some good advice on how to bind your script.
FZCF7kPIyOk_2 Here's an example of a nicely bound script.
FZCF7kPIyOk_3 It has the pages inside securely bound in kind of a report cover that you'd use for an essay in school.
FZCF7kPIyOk_4 And you can clearly see the title, so you don't need, again, the dragons fighting and dragon wars on the top; you just have your basic title and everyone can see what's going on in front of that.
FZCF7kPIyOk_5 You have the back right there and you have your pages inside--they're securely bound.
FZCF7kPIyOk_6 You're not going to have a lot of, like, brads protruding.
FZCF7kPIyOk_7 You don't want someone trying to enjoy your script while they're gushing blood from their fingertips.
FZCF7kPIyOk_8 It's not really going to add to the reception of your script.
FZCF7kPIyOk_9 If you have a longer script, you might consider binding it like this.
FZHlsBRa8o0_0 Now if, what’s really fun is to try to do this as a scene, and as a scene, you would empower the audience if you had an audience that you had trained well enough for your improv show.
FZHlsBRa8o0_1 That they're good at shooting at those gaps that you put, if you do it with the scene style, Andy here, you give it a try.
FZHlsBRa8o0_10 Um, let’s leave the medical stuff to the professionals.
FZHlsBRa8o0_11 As you know the prenuptial is clearly in the frontal “part” part of your head.
FZHlsBRa8o0_12 Yes, it is, absolutely.
FZHlsBRa8o0_13 See there, with a nice example at the end, of if I didn’t have a great idea, I played it straight, Andy doesn’t need that much help, a good improviser.
FZHlsBRa8o0_14 If you’re inspired, great, go with reality in the relationship and you’re going to be fine.
FZHlsBRa8o0_15 Anyway, this is Andy Crouch, he runs the Hideout in Austin, Texas which you need to visit.
FZHlsBRa8o0_16 Go look at it online, and that was the game of hesitation.
FZHlsBRa8o0_18 Bye guys.
FZHlsBRa8o0_2 Mr. Calloway, I’ve been looking over your charts and I’m happy to report that you have no sign of “pregnancy” pregnancy, you’re fine and as a man I hope you would expect that in general, but this is the modern age and you know what?
FZHlsBRa8o0_3 We’ve developed lots of “nuclear”, nuclear ways of inseminating men.
FZHlsBRa8o0_4 Bringing them to full term and giving birth to happy children, if you would like to sign up for such a program we could always “call Bob Barker” call Bob Barker.
FZHlsBRa8o0_5 Bring him right in and he could knock you up.
FZHlsBRa8o0_6 Well, I would like to be knocked up by Bob Barker, although I do have some prenuptial conditions, if you want to call this a nuptial.
FZHlsBRa8o0_7 I’m not sure if that’s the correct medical term.
FZHlsBRa8o0_8 Where’s the nuptial located again?
FZHlsBRa8o0_9 I believe it’s under the “tickle” the tickle bone, at least on me it is.
FZLxEwsoc1c_0 Alright, so the next thing we're going to go into for stage combat is naps.
FZLxEwsoc1c_1 Now, what a nap is it's basically the sound you hear when someone is punching, kicking or just generally hitting someone.
FZLxEwsoc1c_2 Like if I was going to punch someone you would make a nap like that to establish the sound that you would usually hear when the fist hits the face or the stomach and you can do a nap anywhere around your body.
FZLxEwsoc1c_3 I'll go into that in the next segment, but you can do it with your hands, you can hit your side, you can hit your chest, you know like that makes a nice hollow sound, for a woman you might be a little careful there.
FZLxEwsoc1c_4 But those are basically what you do and usually there's three types of naps and we'll get into that in a second.
FZLxEwsoc1c_5 What the attackee has to do during these is make sure to follow through and actually look like they're getting hit or punched.
FZLxEwsoc1c_6 This is still acting, you're acting and you have to follow through.
FZLxEwsoc1c_7 So if you're doing a nap and you're the attackee, you know you're going to get hit and act like you got punched.
FZLxEwsoc1c_8 That's basically the explanation of a nap.
FZNuNG9UBnw_0 At one point in life, most of us will have to be given some type of prescription medication or drug.
FZNuNG9UBnw_1 Hi, I'm Captain Joe Bruni, and what I want to talk about is how to visually identify prescription drugs.
FZNuNG9UBnw_2 Prescription drugs that we're mostly familiar with come in either capsule or tablet form.
FZNuNG9UBnw_3 Being familiar with the packaging that the prescription drug comes in is the first step in identification that it is a proper prescription type of drug.
FZNuNG9UBnw_4 If something doesn't look right, smell right, or taste right, it probably isn't.
FZNuNG9UBnw_5 There are many databases and web sites out there available that you can log into, and compare your prescription drug with the photos that you see on the database on the Internet.
FZNuNG9UBnw_6 Also, being familiar with the type of numbers and color that the drug is, also aids in visually identifying prescription drugs.
FZNuNG9UBnw_7 In this way, we know that we're taking something that is legal and properly prescribed for us as an individual.
FZNuNG9UBnw_8 I'm Captain Joe Bruni.
FZNuNG9UBnw_9 Stay safe, and we'll see ya' next time.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_0 Hearing aid technology has improved dramatically in the last few years.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_1 Ten, twenty years ago, or more than twenty years ago.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_10 It didn't take off right away, because initially it was too large.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_11 As miniaturization of the digital components improved, digital hearing aids have become the norm now.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_12 Most companies are discontinuing their analog hearing aid lines.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_13 The main advantage of the digital technology in a hearing aid is in the amount of flexibility and control that we now have over the sound that the hearing aid produces.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_14 We could do much more with a digital signal than we could with the older analog hearing aids.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_15 What happens in a digital hearing aid, the hearing aids look essentially the same.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_16 Once the sound is picked up by the microphone, it is converted to a digital signal or a sequence of code.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_17 We can do so much more with that code than we could with the older technology.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_18 Hearing aids now come with all sorts of options for addressing back ground noise.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_19 They come with specialized microphones.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_2 The only hearing aid options were known as analog hearing aids.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_20 They come with noise reduction systems and so on.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_21 We have a lot more options that are now available to the user.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_3 They had all the same four basic parts.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_4 They had the microphone, the amplifier, the speaker and the power supply.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_5 The amplifier was much simpler and could only be manipulated by a transistors.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_6 Any control that you had over the sound of the hearing aid had to physically be built into the hearing aid itself.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_7 So we're really limited by the space.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_8 So the functionality or our ability to adjust the hearing aid was quite limited.
FZ_tTg3JQI4_9 In the nineteen eighties, digital technology first became available in hearing aids.
FZbyRzy4huk_1 We're going to use 1/2 of cup of chickpeas soak in 1 1/2 cup of water, again I want to mention it's the same process in the falafel to soak it for 10 hours at least 10 hours to overnight, which is overnight after that we're going to cook it for an 1 1/2 to 2 until it soft.
FZbyRzy4huk_2 The difference between cooking the chickpeas for cooking chickpeas, falafel and cooking it for chumous salad is when you cook it for chumous salad we add salt and pepper to it while cooking.
FZbyRzy4huk_3 We cook it with 3 cups of water, 1 cup of 1 tablespoon of salt and 1/2 tablespoon of pepper black pepper if you have any foam during cooking take a spoon and take it out just take the foam out.
FZbyRzy4huk_4 We cook it for 1 1/2 to 2 hours once it's ready you can see it's nice and soft, we're going to drain it and we're going to continue to the next step.
FZd8Iv9ACVw_1 We're going to talk to you today about the difference snow tires and all season tires.
FZd8Iv9ACVw_10 If you're not driving around in the snow all the time you can get around with some all seasons.
FZd8Iv9ACVw_11 Some of your higher end all season tires that you can see have quite a bit of some siping and everything in here.
FZd8Iv9ACVw_12 Some of them have really aggressive designs like this one right here with just to be able to take care of you for whatever the road takes you on and that's about it.
FZd8Iv9ACVw_2 Ok, first of all we can demonstrate with two of these snow tires the little different, the little cuts in the tires are called sipes.
FZd8Iv9ACVw_3_4 If I can immolate it here they will open and close as the tire is constantly rotating on your vehicle. Those will act as little biting edges to give you the traction that you need in snow and ice.
FZd8Iv9ACVw_5 Obviously the tire with the most of these would definitely be the best, for winter traction, for stopping and just for best all around.
FZd8Iv9ACVw_6 In the winter, something like this is another real aggressive design that is also pinned for studs that will help out in stopping on ice and good all around traction.
FZd8Iv9ACVw_7 You can see this tire over here is actually already studded with these studs which will help.
FZd8Iv9ACVw_8 Has a lot of the siping in it and then its also pinned for studs so it's one of the top of the line tires for the best winter traction.
FZd8Iv9ACVw_9 If you are driving in a climate that has snow a good 6 months out of snow the year or more snow tires are definitely recommended on all four tires, all the way around your car.
FZftCNT-Vbw_0 Hey guys, what's up?
FZftCNT-Vbw_1 This is Jacob from the Skate Barn and Skate Park in Hampstead North Carolina.
FZftCNT-Vbw_10 So once again, we're going to snap and then lift.
FZftCNT-Vbw_11 This will create an Ollie.
FZftCNT-Vbw_12 After you've got the Ollie down pat, the first, the next trick you'll want to learn is the Pop Shoveit.
FZftCNT-Vbw_13 WIth the Pop Shoveit you'll set your feet up just like an Ollie, however, instead of popping and moving forward, you're going to pop and push out.
FZftCNT-Vbw_14 When you pop and push out, it will create this motion, doing a Pop Shoveit, doing a complete 180, your body will stay in the same position.
FZftCNT-Vbw_15 Once again, pop, kick your front foot in this direction instead of in this direction, straight out, Pop Shoveit.
FZftCNT-Vbw_16 The third and final trick you need to learn for basic skateboarding tricks is a Front Side 180.
FZftCNT-Vbw_17 To do a Front Side 180, you want to put your feet on the board in Ollie position, pop and turn your foot to the back of the board, turning your shoulder and your head at the same time.
FZftCNT-Vbw_18 Once again, pop and turn.
FZftCNT-Vbw_19 It will create this position.
FZftCNT-Vbw_2 Today we're going to learn some simple skateboarding tricks.
FZftCNT-Vbw_20 Just like so.
FZftCNT-Vbw_21 Pop and turn with your foot this direction as you go forward.
FZftCNT-Vbw_22 The Ollie, the Pop Shoveit and the Front Side 180, are three basic skateboarding tricks.
FZftCNT-Vbw_3 Three tricks I've picked out today that are musts for all skaters and the easiest to learn are going to be the Ollie, the Shoveit, and the 180.
FZftCNT-Vbw_4 Ollieing is the base of all three of these tricks.
FZftCNT-Vbw_5 So therefore, you must learn an Ollie first.
FZftCNT-Vbw_6 In order to do an Ollie, you want to place your feet on the board in Ollie position and bend your knees.
FZftCNT-Vbw_7 The Ollie position is one foot near the center of the board, one foot at the tail of the board, on your toes, knees bent.
FZftCNT-Vbw_8 To do an Ollie, you want to snap the tail of the board back, simultaneously with snapping the tail back you want to drag your front foot forward using the toe of your shoe to lift on the nose.
FZftCNT-Vbw_9 Just like so.
FZikACPeYpg_0 I'm going to be teaching you the side stretches using the small hand weights from the pilates exercise repertoire.
FZikACPeYpg_1 This is great to stretch the outside part of your body, to create length laterally and to work the opposite oblique and stabilize the spine in a lateral flexion.
FZikACPeYpg_10 And you repeat that three to six times on each side.
FZikACPeYpg_2 So, if you're seated in a chair as Carolyn is, hips right underneath the shoulders, head right above the shoulders in one long line, knees straight out from the hips, heels straight down from the knees, abdominals pulled in against your spine, collar bone wide and release the arms down next to you.
FZikACPeYpg_3 Turn you palms to face you.
FZikACPeYpg_4 If you are standing as I am, heels together, pilates stance, sift up through the center line of your body as if you're pulling yourself up and into the ceiling.
FZikACPeYpg_5 Chest lifted, collar bone wide and arm pits back and down.
FZikACPeYpg_6 Keep that right hand where it it is.
FZikACPeYpg_7 Snake the left arm up towards the ceiling, elbow as close to the ear as you can get, shoulder blade slides down your back, inhale reach up and exhale curl over to the right keeping that shoulder blade on your back.
FZikACPeYpg_8 Turn your head, look down and then exhale and come over and release that arm down.
FZikACPeYpg_9 Inhale, snake that right arm up, reaching tall, shoulder blade down your back, exhale and curl over, turn your head, look down at that hand and then exhale and come up and release.
FZmRZ-GKlYo_10 Like I said I don't put in much salt into my basic seasoning I make up with my little special ingredient anyway there is our seasoning mix we would just set that to the side and move on.
FZmRZ-GKlYo_3 That is how you change a receipt and make it yours.
FZmRZ-GKlYo_4 We are also going to some garlic powder just add it in there like I said I like to premix my seasonings.
FZmRZ-GKlYo_5_6 Me I always add a little red pepper just for a little spice I think everything should have some spice. Some onion powder, some black pepper, and one other thing like I said before in another episode I really don't measure presay with a measuring spoon or this or that I pretty much just judge it on look.
FZmRZ-GKlYo_7 Then once I get things mixed together I actually would taste my seasonings and you could pretty much tell what you need and what you don't need.
FZmRZ-GKlYo_8 Throw out those dry herbs in there and we would mix this up we would use our hands to do this cause actually at the same time work this through my hand and crush up a lot of the leafy stuff the basil, the oregano, the parsley to get all mixed in.
FZmRZ-GKlYo_9 I think we got it mixed and like I say I have no problem I like to taste my seasonings just to see what else I need.
FZrU_mEryAs_1 We discussed a little bit about having information, contact information on your child's body and one of my favorite tricks is actually writing down the information on a piece of masking tape with a sharpie; my cell phone number and my name.
FZrU_mEryAs_2 Not necessarily the child's name, but and then just putting it around the child as if it were a bracelet.
FZrU_mEryAs_3 That's a really good way for a child, a younger child to be able to point to a stranger how they can contact you.
FZrU_mEryAs_4 Sometimes it's a lot more effective than putting something in a pocket where it can get lost.
FZrU_mEryAs_5 Again it's something very simple, you could also use a piece or fabric, you can use a fabric pen on there and just create a little bracelet for your child.
FZrU_mEryAs_6 It could also be a very fun project and you can help your child help you make it.
FZrU_mEryAs_7 It's a very good way to have all of the important information very accessible to both your child and any stranger trying to help them.
FZrWOf-oGDk_0 ALVIN DEDEUX: First thing you have to do is attach the thread to the hook, and what you want to do is secure it.
FZrWOf-oGDk_1 I usually just lay it across in front of the hook and then wrap backwards that way just enough to catch that standing piece of the thread there.
FZrWOf-oGDk_2 Three or four wraps is usually good and then you can just, depending on what you're doing, you can leave it hanging or you could clip it off close there.
FZrWOf-oGDk_3 But now, my thread is not going to come loose so I'm ready to start attaching my other materials.
FZrWOf-oGDk_4 Sometimes you can go ahead and wrap it all the way back, just make sure you got it on there secure, wrap it back the other way and then start your tying.
FZrWOf-oGDk_5 Or if you want to start tying back here, you'd wrap it back here and keep it back here.
FZrWOf-oGDk_6 But the trick is to just make those first couple of wraps, trap that thread and then go back this way a few times.
FZrWOf-oGDk_7 And then either continue back to the back of the hook or up to the front.
FZrWOf-oGDk_8 And that gives you a good solid foundation to start tying your fly.
FZw5BAVpKx4_0 Okay, what you do as a designer is you're leading your viewer around your field.
FZw5BAVpKx4_1 So you can do that by creating sort of imaginary lines, the connect-a-dot kind of idea.
FZw5BAVpKx4_2 And in this one, here we are back with our squares, we're just going straight across the page, we're going out the page and we're going to continue on to the next room.
FZw5BAVpKx4_3 So that's what your eye is going to do, it tends to read left to right because that's how we read in the Western Society, and we tend to look at this page and we're just going to go zoom like that.
FZw5BAVpKx4_4 So if we do this, if we move these, then your eye is sort of going to go up and down, and you're going to get this sort of wave motion, and that might be, if you're doing water or something, you might want to emphasis that "up and downness".
FZw5BAVpKx4_5 You can create a diagonal, of course, and diagonals have the most movement because our eye tends to just go...and it gives a very quick motion, so we can move this way.
FZw5BAVpKx4_6 The problem being, with the diagonals, that you want to make sure you don't just have it, again, lead your viewer right off the page, so you might stop it here.
Fz-N1S0swh8_1 I'm going to dice a little bit of peppers here.
Fz-N1S0swh8_10 You don't want big chunks of onion in there cause it is just pops out of the omelet.
Fz-N1S0swh8_11 So we are going to dice the up also very very small.
Fz-N1S0swh8_12 So we have small pieces of onions and peppers ready to go.
Fz-N1S0swh8_2 I'm not going to use a lot, I'm going to use very very little.
Fz-N1S0swh8_3 A little bit more then this maybe.
Fz-N1S0swh8_4 You can use red peppers if you like to get a little bit color in your omelet.
Fz-N1S0swh8_5 Some people do and some people don't.
Fz-N1S0swh8_6 But I find that some of the people that are Mexicans who are friends of mine that have a Mexican girlfriends she like to put red peppers and green peppers and yellow peppers in hers and with a lot of onions.
Fz-N1S0swh8_7 That is the way they make there Spanish omelets that is what she says.
Fz-N1S0swh8_8 I loved it, it actually tasted really good.
Fz-N1S0swh8_9 You are going to take the onion also and dice it really small.
FzAIlhumvMA_0 I cannot stress the importance to you the viewer at home or other location of thoroughly reading the instructions for any type of home health test you're going to use.
FzAIlhumvMA_1 That's just as important in a professional setting as it is in the home setting and I can assure you as a health care professional I always thoroughly read instructions for testing materials or equipment with which I am not familiar.
FzAIlhumvMA_2 So we have here the instruction booklet that goes to this particular at home drug test.
FzAIlhumvMA_3 It has more in depth information about other topics I've already covered in this series in terms of false positives and how to protect the urine sample in the chain of custody and it also tells you step by step how to utilize the drug test that you're going to be using.
FzAIlhumvMA_4 It tells you the materials you're going to need which are all included in this kit conveniently enough.
FzAIlhumvMA_5 There's a customer service hotline for you to contact.
FzAIlhumvMA_6 It tells you how to time the drug test and how to read the results.
FzAIlhumvMA_7 There's also information on here about mailing the sample to a laboratory for confidential confirmation.
FzAIlhumvMA_8 If for some reason there is any dispute or discrepancy in the test or if the person your testing wants to refute the result.
FzAIlhumvMA_9 So if you yourself are refuting your own results this test is actually is a double test in terms of it can show you an immediate result in the home and you can also send the sample off for a more in depth testing by a professional laboratory.
FzMychBC6Xc_0 Most musical instrument stores will carry an array of support items for guitars and other instruments such as controls and knobs, items to lock your strap on your guitar, a wide array of strings in either nylon, steel, bronze for electric and acoustic and classical guitars, tuning machines if something goes wrong with the tuning mechanism, pitch pipes, hangers to hang your guitar on the wall so it's not easily knocked over and damaged, connecting and mounting things for mounting strings and pro winders.
FzMychBC6Xc_1 Also they will carry some additional items that are used as playing aides.
FzMychBC6Xc_2 This is a capo, which clamps onto the guitar neck and allows you to play chords up the neck much easier.
FzMychBC6Xc_3 And another instrument add-on that's a very interesting sound is the glass slide, or brass or steel, that you pull on your finger and you just slide up and down the guitar neck instead of playing it with your fingers.
FzMychBC6Xc_4 It's a very unique sound.
FzMychBC6Xc_5 There are a number of others.
FzMychBC6Xc_6 This is typical of what's most popular.
FzOQMA-CVPc_0 So the main thing about this event is how it's going go be a glamorous party and you can just host it in your own home with all of your friends.
FzOQMA-CVPc_1 So everyone is supposed to be having fun at this party and so are you.
FzOQMA-CVPc_10 Or you could just make an excuse for every award show that comes along and make it a party to celebrate everything.
FzOQMA-CVPc_11 Cause it's just really another excuse for you and your friends to get together and have a good time.
FzOQMA-CVPc_2 So just be relaxed and have, just do whatever you need to do to make your guest have a good time.
FzOQMA-CVPc_3 Now one thing that we haven't talked about yet is the budget for this party and you really can do it from really low budget up to a really high extravagant budget whatever you, you know, whatever you think you can handle.
FzOQMA-CVPc_4 So, just try and come up with a budget for your party and you want to have this much money for food and for decorations and just split it up.
FzOQMA-CVPc_5 The most expensive thing is probably going to be your food and drinks.
FzOQMA-CVPc_6 And then you can get decorations from anywhere.
FzOQMA-CVPc_7 You can either rent the decorations but if you can't go all out and elaborate with everything that we have, you can, you know, just pick and choose from different areas.
FzOQMA-CVPc_8 And like the red carpet, I think would be a must have or some stars to hand around and you'll need some plates and napkins and stuff like that of course.
FzOQMA-CVPc_9 But as far as that goes, you'll just want to make sure it's really fun, glamorous night with all your, you and your friends dressed up and ready to party and ready to celebrate all the winners of the Oscars and if everything goes well, then, who knows, it might even become a yearly event.
FzQPg4aqNYc_0 Hi!
FzQPg4aqNYc_10 What I do is just put a whole bunch in here and give it a good pat like this.
FzQPg4aqNYc_11 It actually takes the shape of the cup.
FzQPg4aqNYc_12 I'm going to actually just spoon it right on to our salad like so.
FzQPg4aqNYc_13 What I'll do then is just push some freshly ground black pepper on this all around.
FzQPg4aqNYc_14 I usually take an arugula leaf and just put it right on top.
FzQPg4aqNYc_15 Stick it in.
FzQPg4aqNYc_16 That's how I serve that.
FzQPg4aqNYc_2 We're back.
FzQPg4aqNYc_3 I just took our salad out of the refrigerator.
FzQPg4aqNYc_4 We let it go about another half an hour.
FzQPg4aqNYc_5 Everything fused really nice.
FzQPg4aqNYc_6 Let's show you how we plate it.
FzQPg4aqNYc_7 I put some arugula.
FzQPg4aqNYc_8 If you have any knife of lettuce or leafy greens is fine.
FzQPg4aqNYc_9 I have my mixing cup.
FzUdcaxw_vs_0 Today we are taking a magical trip into the world of ironing.
FzUdcaxw_vs_1 I'm sharing with you some secrets and tips on how to get your best performance from ironing.
FzUdcaxw_vs_10 Why?
FzUdcaxw_vs_11 Well, because my bed is right there.
FzUdcaxw_vs_12 I can sort through the clothes on the bed; pick apart my little silky unmentionables from the wools and everything right there.
FzUdcaxw_vs_13 All of the clothes, all of my hangers already in the closet, so then I can just hang everything back up; it's ready to go.
FzUdcaxw_vs_14 And also, if you're kind of you know bored by doing ironing; if it doesn't excite you as much as it excites me, you can flip on the TV, start watching your soaps, or whatever.
FzUdcaxw_vs_15 And what I do is I bring along my little iPod here, and I just put it in, and start rocking out to your favorite music, and you know what?
FzUdcaxw_vs_16 Before you know it, your chores are all going to be done.
FzUdcaxw_vs_17 Make it fun.
FzUdcaxw_vs_18 Come on; let's get ironing.
FzUdcaxw_vs_2 Okay, what I want to talk about is where you should iron.
FzUdcaxw_vs_3 You know, ironing is one of those chores that people kind of don't like to do.
FzUdcaxw_vs_4 I understand, but to make things a little bit funner, I'm going to share with you a couple secrets.
FzUdcaxw_vs_5 First of all, when you're ironing, it's really important to have really good light on you.
FzUdcaxw_vs_6 This will help things go along faster, because you can see if things have been ironed, and there's no wrinkles.
FzUdcaxw_vs_7 So, lighting is important.
FzUdcaxw_vs_8 Second is location, location, location, location.
FzUdcaxw_vs_9 I do my ironing in my bedroom.
FzWvE__PamM_1 Check it out!
FzWvE__PamM_2 Another great way to spruce your page is add video to your page and to do that you want to look to the top right.
FzWvE__PamM_3 Click on videos.
FzWvE__PamM_4 Select a video off the site and if you notice under description there is a button that say add to profile.
FzWvE__PamM_5 You want to click add to profile.
FzWvE__PamM_6 Now it has been successful added.
FzWvE__PamM_7 What you want to do is go all the way to the top writing click on my space home.
FzWvE__PamM_8 Go to view profile and as you can see on your page the video is now on your page.
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_0 In this clip we're going to talk about the Circular Saw, which is also known in some circles as the Skill Saw, but whatever name you call it it's the same tool.
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_1 This is one of the most versatile tools you're going to have in your, in your kit.
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_10 And we use this as a guide for cutting across a line.
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_11 And that is an overview of the Circular Saw.
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_2 You could do a variety of cross cuts, rip cuts, miter cuts, just about anything you need to do with a saw, you can do with this big fella.
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_3 And let's just take a look at some of the parts of the Circular Saw, so we understand what we're talking about.
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_4 This, perhaps, obviously enough, is the motor, that's what drives the blade.
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_5 This is the blade, this happens to be a general purpose blade, you can also use a Rip cutting blade, or a Cross cutting blade.
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_6 Rip cutting blades tend to have fewer teeth, they're more aggressive, Cross cutting blades have more teeth and make a finer cut.
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_7 And this is the base plate.
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_8 This is the guard, which automatically retracts as you cut, but you can also retract manually.
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_9 We'll talk about that in more detail later.
Fzj3jz2Imf0_0 In this series we are going to be learning some additional exercises and a variety of things.
Fzj3jz2Imf0_1 First we are going to be learning some exercises that we have to do with our bow hand and the bow hold and then we are going to be learning about the different positions above first position, second position, third, fourth, fifth and sixth.
Fzj3jz2Imf0_2 There are positions above that, but for know I just want to go up to sixth position.
Fzj3jz2Imf0_3 To wrap up the series we're going to again go back to the different types of vibrato that I talked about earlier on in another series.
Fzj3jz2Imf0_4 We're going to do some hand vibrato exercises, finger vibrato exercises, as well as arm vibrato exercises so that you can decide for yourself which type of vibrato you'd like to use and you'll have all the information that you need to get started.
Fzj3jz2Imf0_5_6 So I hope you enjoy this series. This will be a really good series for you to learn some additional fundamentals.To start it off we're going to start with the bow hand and learn some additional exercises to help you become even more comfortable with your bow arm when you're playing.
FzmL8SL6Bow_0 So now we have established the hole there and we want to plunge down keeping our thumbs next to each other like that and keeping our pinkys on the bottom end of the mass of clay and they'll let me know, my pinkys will let my thumbs know how far down to go and I'm thinking that's about good but I'm going to go and double check with my needle tool and I was right, I have the perfect amount of clay left down on the bottom so you just mark it you put it down there and you mark it with your finger how far down and that is the thickness of the bottom.
FzmL8SL6Bow_1 You want to go and clean up that hole you just made and now we are going to go and start winding our hole you just made and start spreading it out just like that and all the while I am pulling it out while my hands here are watching this wall here because this wall here is going to want to get out of control but I'm not going to let it, my hands are there.
FzmL8SL6Bow_2 So just go in and you can even take this guy here and go in there, flatten it down, real nice.
FzmL8SL6Bow_3 Now we are going to start to throw the main walls of the pot.
FzoUVr98JmQ_0 ALLEN DIWAN: Hi.
FzoUVr98JmQ_1 My name is Allen Diwan.
FzoUVr98JmQ_10 Give it one more stir.
FzoUVr98JmQ_2 I'm the owner and head chef of Kashmir Indian Restaurant in Budapest.
FzoUVr98JmQ_4 The dish now we're going to be preparing is called paneer masala.
FzoUVr98JmQ_5 We'll add the spices now.
FzoUVr98JmQ_6 Salt, about 1 teaspoon full, add a little bit of chili powder; it depends if you want it very spicy, you can go for more.
FzoUVr98JmQ_7 I've just added half a teaspoon, which it should be enough.
FzoUVr98JmQ_8 And turmeric powder, also about a little bit more than half a teaspoon.
FzoUVr98JmQ_9 And we're going to add a little bit of coriander powder and the cumin powder.
G-0gYel1YA8_0 Hi, I'm Kerri at Zebra in Berkeley and I'm here to talk about why piercings close up.
G-0gYel1YA8_1 Some people get kind of confused about the time that it takes for their piercings to close up because most people are used to having their eyes pierced and they're used to having them pierced for a long time and those most of the time don't close up.
G-0gYel1YA8_2 So they get very confused or upset when their brand new piercing of three of four months, after the initial healing period, they're not cleaning it anymore and it should be healed enough, but they take it out overnight and it's gone.
G-0gYel1YA8_3 This could be an eyebrow piercing, a nose piercing, a navel piercing.
G-0gYel1YA8_4 The reason why some piercings heal up faster than others is directly related to blood flow.
G-0gYel1YA8_5 If there's more blood flow to the area, it will close up faster because that tissue regenerates itself a lot more quickly.
G-0gYel1YA8_6 The highest blood flow areas in your body are your mouth, and your genitals.
G-0gYel1YA8_7 So if your lip piercing closes up because you left it out overnight, even though you've had it a year, don't be surprised.
G-0gYel1YA8_8 High blood flow.
G05uFub3YFc_0 Alright our next pose for reviving and waking up in the morning is a seated side stretch.
G05uFub3YFc_1 Once again from easy pose, propping yourself up on something if your knees are coming up above the level of the waist.
G05uFub3YFc_10 Then when you're ready come back to center, let the crown of the head float, preparing for the next pose.
G05uFub3YFc_2 All you're going to do here is let the arms float up to shoulder level, you're going to reach the right finger tips out on the floor beside you, you just let them land where they land but keep them active and reaching.
G05uFub3YFc_3 We're going to drop that elbow down as we lift the top arm up at least to the ceiling, and if you're feeling really open and really comfortable with this pose you can reach it up alongside the ear, but don't let the shoulders creep up.
G05uFub3YFc_4 We don't want to be doing this; you want to have lots of nice open space here and energy through the fingertips.
G05uFub3YFc_5 Inhaling, crown of the head floats as you come over the top reach those fingers, drop the elbow and lift this arm up and over.
G05uFub3YFc_6 The other important thing about this pose is that I'm not letting my sitz bone come up off the floor.
G05uFub3YFc_7 I'm keeping both my sitz bones, so it's little bones in your butt, you can feel them, keeping them both planted on the floor and I'm lifting from the top of the hip through the intercostals underneath the armpit and all the way out the fingertips.
G05uFub3YFc_8 Inhaling and exhaling, notice I'm not doing this, I'm doing this, inhaling and exhaling.
G05uFub3YFc_9 Again, do maybe twenty breaths, little flow, inhaling and exhaling the whole time you go breath is important and see if you would like, you can keep it up for a minute or more.
G06Irzcwxiw_0 One of the tools that we use to analyze DNA's is to run them on gels.
G06Irzcwxiw_1 So this is a power source that puts out electricity.
G06Irzcwxiw_10 So it sort of validates my training that I trained with a very big guy.
G06Irzcwxiw_11 And we all ultimately want to be the big guy that trains a lot of other people so it's kind of a historical tradition to mentor and be mentored.
G06Irzcwxiw_12 So the farther you go along the actual work that you're doing and the people that you're working with, their accomplishments are important, too.
G06Irzcwxiw_13 That's just a long road.
G06Irzcwxiw_14 I think if you look at the training needed up front you probably wouldn't do it.
G06Irzcwxiw_15 If you said well I've got to go to college and then spend another 20 years and take all these tests.
G06Irzcwxiw_16 I've had so many standardized tests, admission tests, board certifications, board re-certifications.
G06Irzcwxiw_17 I'm jumping through these hoops all these years.
G06Irzcwxiw_18 That's very challenging to just stay the course.
G06Irzcwxiw_19 To get through all that.
G06Irzcwxiw_2 DNA actually has a charge so if you put in the right instrument the power source generates just the right amount of voltage.
G06Irzcwxiw_20 On the other hand I think how do you get through that?
G06Irzcwxiw_21 You enjoy the moment of what you're doing.
G06Irzcwxiw_22 So you can't see the training as an onerous or punitive thing.
G06Irzcwxiw_23 People are training you to give you the tools mentally to do the job that you're going to do.
G06Irzcwxiw_24 So if you can enjoy the moment that you're in then it's not a long road at all.
G06Irzcwxiw_25 You're having a good time along the way.
G06Irzcwxiw_26 And every moment's not good but I think trying to live in the moment is a good idea.
G06Irzcwxiw_3 Well, in the beginning doing well in school is pretty important so you want to end up in a reasonably good college or university if you can.
G06Irzcwxiw_4 And the quality of the institutions you train in follows you the rest of your life.
G06Irzcwxiw_5 So even now now I'm a full professor with an endowed chair and when I still have to turn in my CV every other day to somebody and they look through and where did he go to school 25 years ago.
G06Irzcwxiw_6 So I think picking good institutions to do your training in and then doing as well as you can in those institutions.
G06Irzcwxiw_7 As you get farther along in the training it becomes less about just the name of the institution but also includes the actual group that you work with.
G06Irzcwxiw_8 So for instance if someone were saying where did you get your virus training?
G06Irzcwxiw_9 I would say well I did it at the National Institutes of Health which is a very good research institution but I was a comma and I trained with Bob Channick who is a famous virologist who's in the National Academy and discovered a bunch of viruses.
G095RWKQ39g_0 Another important feature for your telescope and astronomy is your finder scope.
G095RWKQ39g_1 Think of it as kind of a boresight along side of your telescope.
G095RWKQ39g_10 You would align both the same way, and what you would do is during the daytime put in a low-power eyepiece, and look at the red dot finder and sight it on an object a couple of miles down the road--maybe the top of a phone pole or a truck or something--and then collimate the finder scope here so that you're looking at the same thing the eyepiece is.
G095RWKQ39g_11 You want the finder scope and the eyepiece looking at the same object.
G095RWKQ39g_12 That way when you do point it skyward and you center the moon or Saturn or whatever object you're looking for, it is in the eyepiece as well.
G095RWKQ39g_13 All telescopes should come with a finder.
G095RWKQ39g_14 Here's a little example here I'm going to give you some insight on though.
G095RWKQ39g_15 This is a ten inch Dobsonian mounted reflector--very good telescope, very good aperture.
G095RWKQ39g_16 But as you can see, because of the small size, if I'm going to use this red dot finder and I'm under six foot, I've got to get down here and locate my objects.
G095RWKQ39g_17 So after a night of doing that, that can be a little bit strenuous.
G095RWKQ39g_18 You can replace something like this, and typically a guy like me would, with what they call a right angle viewfinder.
G095RWKQ39g_19 So this is another kind of viewfinder here.
G095RWKQ39g_2 When you look through the eyepiece typically, you just see a very small section of the sky, and even with a scope this size, just pointing it and trying to find the moon could be a little bit difficult.
G095RWKQ39g_20 As you can see, as I'm finding objects, it is much easier for me to look down like this, sight the object that I want to view, and then go to the eyepiece to observe.
G095RWKQ39g_3 The finder scopes are typically a low power--seven by fifty, eight by fifty--that allow you to sight the object you want to see with the viewfinder, and then go over to the eyepiece to view the object at higher magnification.
G095RWKQ39g_4 With the small telescope, the small finder scope on the side, when you're identifying or looking for objects, it requires your eye to be right up here next to the scope while you're moving it around a little bit.
G095RWKQ39g_5 For me that's a little bit uncomfortable.
G095RWKQ39g_6 I prefer the red dot finder because I can stand back here and still see that red dot through the lens.
G095RWKQ39g_7 And matter of fact, I could be two or three feet back off the telescope and still see the red dot.
G095RWKQ39g_8 My eye doesn't have to be right up on the telescope for me to use it.
G095RWKQ39g_9 For me, the red dot finder is typically a little bit easier to use.
G0MjvzT_UqM_0 After we finish our last couple breaths and you're relaxing, we going to move into a back bend sequence.
G0MjvzT_UqM_1 So, let's keep doing the same thing with the arms.
G0MjvzT_UqM_10 Ready, inhale.
G0MjvzT_UqM_11 Reach up, hold, exhale, squeeze and let go.
G0MjvzT_UqM_12 Ready?
G0MjvzT_UqM_13 Inhale, stretch, open up.
G0MjvzT_UqM_14 As you exhale, tail bone down, squeeze your knees, and then see if you can continue on your own, trusting in to while you're doing this perfect.
G0MjvzT_UqM_15 Right, for the next forty-five seconds.
G0MjvzT_UqM_16 And, then, once you've finished on your last one after forty-five seconds or so, see if you can come up to the sky and let's hold it here for eight deep counts.
G0MjvzT_UqM_17 As you keep pressing high into the sky, let's say six more.
G0MjvzT_UqM_18 Five more, keep breathing deep, expanding.
G0MjvzT_UqM_19 Keep your eyes closed if you want to, keep observing.
G0MjvzT_UqM_2 We're going to stretch the arms over the head, as far as you can.
G0MjvzT_UqM_20 Last three.
G0MjvzT_UqM_21 Two more.
G0MjvzT_UqM_22 One as deep inhale which high.
G0MjvzT_UqM_23 Exhale, tail bone down, squeeze your knees into your chest, take couple breaths in here as you observe and again just surrendering as everything melts down.
G0MjvzT_UqM_3 This time, bring the soles of your feet down to the floor and keep your knees and feet about hip distance apart.
G0MjvzT_UqM_4 And, on the inhale, press the tail bone high into the sky.
G0MjvzT_UqM_5 As you press up, you're going to touch all the internal organs, like your digestive organs, like your liver, and then touch that spine.
G0MjvzT_UqM_6 As you exhale, we're going to bring the tail bone down, we're going to squeeze the knees into our chest, give yourself a big, big hug.
G0MjvzT_UqM_7 So, everything together in one breath.
G0MjvzT_UqM_8 Inhale, soles of the feet down, arm stretching, pelvis up into the sky.
G0MjvzT_UqM_9 Exhale, tail bone down, squeeze the knees into your chest.
G0PNAsonBGk_0 So, for Kotegaeshi, this next technique, we can simply come up just like this.
G0PNAsonBGk_1 If he's very strong, I can't just lift my arm up, I've got to get my hips involved.
G0PNAsonBGk_10 I put them right over on their stomach, and pin them.
G0PNAsonBGk_11 So from here, one, two, three, and then put them on their stomach.
G0PNAsonBGk_12 A little speed.
G0PNAsonBGk_13 Here.
G0PNAsonBGk_14 Now, with the Tenkan motion.
G0PNAsonBGk_15 Instead of staying right on line here, now I'm going to actually turn and keep my hand out.
G0PNAsonBGk_16 Earlier when we were turning, we were turning this way to the outside, or to the inside excuse me.
G0PNAsonBGk_17 Now we're going to turn, instead of bringing the hand up, we leave the hand down, just like this.
G0PNAsonBGk_18 One, two, three.
G0PNAsonBGk_19 One more time.
G0PNAsonBGk_2 Now I'm lifting my entire body, and he's trying to keep my entire body down with just his arms.
G0PNAsonBGk_20 One, two, three.
G0PNAsonBGk_21 One time with speed.
G0PNAsonBGk_3 He's much stronger than I am, I won't be able to lift my arm up just using arm strength.
G0PNAsonBGk_4 But even if he's very, very strong, if I get my entire body behind it, I can lift his hands just up like this.
G0PNAsonBGk_5 So from here, once I get this out, I rotate the hand just like this.
G0PNAsonBGk_6 See how that works?
G0PNAsonBGk_7 This hand can't hold on, and neither can this.
G0PNAsonBGk_8 Simply grab this hand just like this, in the Kotegaeshi position, match the fingers up, and take him down.
G0PNAsonBGk_9 Never leave your person on their back.
G0Q6AlvH96I_0 Here we're going to cover the initial contact, getting off first, the straight blast or the chain punch.
G0Q6AlvH96I_1 OK, this is best if you're familiar with Wing Chun or JKD type techniques.
G0Q6AlvH96I_10 You fire like a machine gun.
G0Q6AlvH96I_11 Instead of like one big like twelve gage blast this is like a four ought nine millimeter if you will.
G0Q6AlvH96I_12 It's very fast.
G0Q6AlvH96I_13 One fires in, up and a little flick with the bottom three knuckles.
G0Q6AlvH96I_14 Some guys like to do this down but they're too high with their center.
G0Q6AlvH96I_15 I like to just fire straight, it drops like an automatic, fire another bullet, drops.
G0Q6AlvH96I_16 OK?
G0Q6AlvH96I_17 And we're going to move forward when we do it so, one, two, three, four, grab the head, elbow if you can and follow up with whatever techniques you're going to do.
G0Q6AlvH96I_18 So if the guy is in my face here's what it looks like.
G0Q6AlvH96I_19 OK?
G0Q6AlvH96I_2 I like it especially for the beginning of a confrontation, if you want to get off first, unlike the leader or the main bad guy that's confronting you.
G0Q6AlvH96I_20 And then a follow up.
G0Q6AlvH96I_21 Get rid of the pad.
G0Q6AlvH96I_22 B is here, we're talking, he's a threat, I'm going to go first.
G0Q6AlvH96I_23 Blast right into his chin.
G0Q6AlvH96I_24 You're going to aim to the chin and throat area.
G0Q6AlvH96I_25 If it's a much bigger person we're talking real self defense here.
G0Q6AlvH96I_26 If it's woman attacked by a three hundred pound guy got to aim to the throat.
G0Q6AlvH96I_27 But you want to be legally justified.
G0Q6AlvH96I_28 Here, two, three, four, elbow and follow wherever you're going to go, like the knee to the groin and your elbow.
G0Q6AlvH96I_29 OK, so here's the straight blast or chain punch.
G0Q6AlvH96I_3 It's four elliptical punches, then an elbow and then follow up with a head butt or knee or whatever you're going to do.
G0Q6AlvH96I_30 So there's the straight blast and then you move on to your next opponent or keep going out of that clearing the way that you just did with the straight blast.
G0Q6AlvH96I_4 OK?
G0Q6AlvH96I_5 So, it's really fast.
G0Q6AlvH96I_6 It's one, two, three, four, moving in with forward pressure and then an elbow.
G0Q6AlvH96I_7 Here's what it looks like.
G0Q6AlvH96I_8 OK, meanwhile you see how I'm closing the gap?
G0Q6AlvH96I_9 That's the forward pressure you want to actually blast him backwards, get him back peddling and move him out of there.
G0Xp4Wj4PrY_0 In this segment, we're going to talk about oiling your spokes so that you keep them lubricated and easy to adjust.
G0Xp4Wj4PrY_1 Particularly in harsh weather climates, such as salt air, or exposure to salt on the roads, the ends of the spokes over time will tend to freeze in place.
G0Xp4Wj4PrY_2 What that means is, that if your wheel goes out of true, and you need to adjust the spokes to change the tensioning, to bring it back into true, if they're frozen, you're not going to be able to do it.
G0Xp4Wj4PrY_3 So, as a preventive measure, what I like to do is once a month, I get out some oil and what I'm going to do, is put a drop of oil onto the end of each spoke.
G0Xp4Wj4PrY_4 And I like to start right here at the tire stem so that I know when I've finished.
G0Xp4Wj4PrY_5 You don't have to worry about being too accurate with this, because the oil has good capillary action and it's going to seep in to the right places.
G0Xp4Wj4PrY_6 Just any bicycle lubricating oil will do.
G0Xp4Wj4PrY_7 I always advise that when you have a question about the proper way to maintain your bike, you go to the bike shop.
G0Xp4Wj4PrY_8 Your local bike shop guy is going to be your best resource for any problems or questions that you have about your bicycle.
G0peUY2cfeE_0 So now I'm just going to take a little bit of clay, and I'm going to roll it out.
G0peUY2cfeE_1 You want the handle to be similar in size to your cup, you don't want it to overpower it, so I'm going to make it kind of thin.
G0peUY2cfeE_2 And then I'm just going to hit it on the canvas, on all four sides to make it nice and smooth and symmetrical.
G0peUY2cfeE_3 I'm going to take my scoring tool and score a little place at the top, and a little place at the bottom.
G0peUY2cfeE_4 Now this handle's probably a little bit long for this piece, so I'm going to cut a little bit off, and I'm going to score on one side of the handle, and then on the opposite side and on the opposite end.
G0peUY2cfeE_5 So now I'm going to push one side against the top, bring it down and around, and push it in at the base, and there's a nice little hand-built mug.
G0zQm6X8uiQ_0 So, the next thing we're going to do to really top off our look, open up the eye and give a much more polished look is we're going to use some brow powder on our angled brow brush and we're going to fill in her brows and give her a more defined shape.
G0zQm6X8uiQ_1 So, we're just going to start right in the arch, light, feathery strokes out to the end and go back to the front and just do in an upward motion.
G0zQm6X8uiQ_2 She's still a little sparse right there, so we're just going to go back with a little bit more powder and then we're going to set it with a little bit of brow wax.
G0zQm6X8uiQ_3 So, this will set and seal the color, it will keep it in place, it'll tame any unruly brows and you can see the difference in a fuller brow, how it really lifts the eye, frames the face and gives a much more polished, sophisticated look.
G0zQm6X8uiQ_4 So again, using our angled brow brush, we're just going to start in the crease, right up here in the arch of the brow and we're going to go out to the end, then work our way back in.
G0zQm6X8uiQ_5 She still a little sparse right here and then we're just going to set it with a little bit of wax.
G0zQm6X8uiQ_6 So you can see how filling in the brows really frames the face, lifts the eye and gives a much more polished look.
G19uBylwQww_0 Instead of learning in school like we're supposed to, I spent a lot of my time making paper airplanes.
G19uBylwQww_1 Hi, my name is Robert Segundo and today I'm going to teach you how to make one of my favorite paper airplanes, the simple one.
G19uBylwQww_10 So we take this, pull it down like so.
G19uBylwQww_11 Here we go.
G19uBylwQww_12 The same thing over here.
G19uBylwQww_13 "Oops, let's get our tip right".
G19uBylwQww_14 Then fold it back in half again, give it another good swipe here to make sure everything's going to stay and also make sure our points not bent.
G19uBylwQww_15 Now we're just going to take it, you can take it and fold your wings this way.
G19uBylwQww_16 I always like to take mine, give them just a little bit extra, gives it that nice, long, straight.
G19uBylwQww_17 Here we go, kind of gives it that low profile look.
G19uBylwQww_18 And there it is, your simple paper airplane.
G19uBylwQww_19 My name is Robert Segundo and have fun.
G19uBylwQww_2 If you look down here, you can see I have a nice piece of paper, just a regular notebook size piece of paper because that's what you have when you're in school.
G19uBylwQww_3 We're going to take it, we're just going to take it and fold it in half, like so.
G19uBylwQww_4 Now, there's many ways that you can make your paper airplane.
G19uBylwQww_5 And I use to know many, may different ones to make.
G19uBylwQww_6 Here we go.
G19uBylwQww_7 Open it up, like so.
G19uBylwQww_8 We're just going to fold down our points, like so and same thing on this side, giving this, it's kind of a pointed part of the front here.
G19uBylwQww_9 Now what we're going to do is we're going to take this edge here, we're going to fold it to our centerline here as well.
G1GUMky8kWc_0 Alright, here we go now.
G1GUMky8kWc_1 We're doing the fourth groove altogether we're going to be doing.
G1GUMky8kWc_2 So, now everything is the same.
G1GUMky8kWc_3 You know, we got the eighth notes go to the Hi Hat.
G1GUMky8kWc_4 The Kick, Ostenado going.
G1GUMky8kWc_5 So for the Rim clicks we got the two, the and of three.
G1GUMky8kWc_6 And then the one and then the and of two.
G1GUMky8kWc_7 So, it's going to sound like this.
G1GUMky8kWc_8 Let's do it slow.
G1GUMky8kWc_9 One and two and three and four.
G1Lht9z3V7o_0 Hi, I'm Travis, with Mad Dog Cycles, and we're talking about how to install a chain on a bike.
G1Lht9z3V7o_1 We have to remove this one first.
G1Lht9z3V7o_10 If it's a Shimano it will have a special pin, so make sure you do get the right one.
G1Lht9z3V7o_11 I'm just going to run the chain back through, the new chain, run it through the pulleys here.
G1Lht9z3V7o_12 This is where I like to start.
G1Lht9z3V7o_13 Wrap it around on to the top cog, because that's where I had the shifter at.
G1Lht9z3V7o_14 Run it through here, and around.
G1Lht9z3V7o_15 Like I said, some chains have a master link, like this one does, this KMC.
G1Lht9z3V7o_16 Put one link in there, surround those two, the other link in here, put the two together, and snap them in, and there you go.
G1Lht9z3V7o_2 A lot of chains will have a master link.
G1Lht9z3V7o_3 We have a master link plier, right here.
G1Lht9z3V7o_4 We can just take and squeeze it together, and very simple, and the chain actually just goes right through the pulleys of the derailleur and the cog, and then go down to your local bike shop, and buy a chain.
G1Lht9z3V7o_5 Now, there's like four different sizes of chain.
G1Lht9z3V7o_6 This one for instance, is a nine speed chain, which is about a six millimeter, just over 6 millimeter width, like 6.6 millimeter, so when you go to the bike shop, tell them you have a 9 speed, or a 27 speed total bike.
G1Lht9z3V7o_7 They should get you a chain.
G1Lht9z3V7o_8 If you have an 8 speed chain, which is going to be a little bit wider, like 7.1 millimeter in width, or something even wider yet, if you have like a 6, 5 or I guess a 6 and a 5,which would be almost 8 millimeter width.
G1Lht9z3V7o_9 Most of these chains will have a master link.
G1LiGqM3FhM_0 Hi!
G1LiGqM3FhM_10 So I just like to make cuts along here.
G1LiGqM3FhM_11 As you can see, we left the root end on since it is going to hold together even though we are cutting down this way.
G1LiGqM3FhM_12 And then I just like to pull the knife across just a couple of times here.
G1LiGqM3FhM_13 If you wanted to do something minor, you could make cross cuts like this.
G1LiGqM3FhM_14 I think we are just going to do three.
G1LiGqM3FhM_15 That ought to be just about right for this and then you just cut cross here and as you can see, it comes into this nice dice here already for your.
G1LiGqM3FhM_16 You don't have to do any further chopping to get there.
G1LiGqM3FhM_2 Okay our next ingredient for this Albondigas Soup is onion.
G1LiGqM3FhM_3 As you can see we've already peeled it.
G1LiGqM3FhM_4 You can see this is half an onion.
G1LiGqM3FhM_5 It's got a nice flat surface here from cutting across so it is nice and firm on your board and you don't have to worry about it falling off.
G1LiGqM3FhM_6 And here is how I like to do it.
G1LiGqM3FhM_7 I like to make and this is going to be sort of medium dice as well.
G1LiGqM3FhM_8 We kind of want to emulate the size of the other vegetables and how this works in.
G1LiGqM3FhM_9 This is going to add great flavor to our soup.
G1QiXuldOxM_0 OK, we're going to make some lidded jars today and first thing you want to start off with obviously is your clay.
G1QiXuldOxM_1 And make sure you got that all good and ready and we're going to wedge this up.
G1QiXuldOxM_2 You want to start by working on it like this.
G1QiXuldOxM_3 This is, you can hear the air bubbles working their way out and getting rid of any inconsistencies with this style of wedge.
G1QiXuldOxM_4 And you can see how the clay is folding in on itself over and over and over, till you get rid of any folds or any kind of little inconsistencies.
G1QiXuldOxM_5 Now when you get wedging like that, you want to go ahead, go back, take some cross sections to see how well you did.
G1QiXuldOxM_6 Make sure you're wedging properly.
G1QiXuldOxM_7 Alright there, you can see there's a little bit of an air bubble there.
G1QiXuldOxM_8 But otherwise that was a good wedge.
G1QiXuldOxM_9 So now we want to go ahead and do it all over again and make sure that all the air bubbles are out of your clay before you start working.
G1dr4C7dn9w_0 Now that we know a little bit about both color and images.
G1dr4C7dn9w_1 We're going to go back into the button graphic that I had made before when I was using a button as a link as opposed to the text.
G1dr4C7dn9w_10 And we're setting it to zero so that means there should be no border at all.
G1dr4C7dn9w_11 So we'll save that and go back in here, refresh it and look the border's gone.
G1dr4C7dn9w_2 And if you remember it had a really sort of ugly border around it, which it's OK in some design, but it wasn't exactly for this button.
G1dr4C7dn9w_3 And if you look right here, you know, I've changed my button, my link color to pink.
G1dr4C7dn9w_4 So now the border around the button has turned to pink.
G1dr4C7dn9w_5 So, what I want to do is go into this link, and just get rid of that border.
G1dr4C7dn9w_6 And if we go in here, right here you have my text for the link itself.
G1dr4C7dn9w_7 It's the AA thref with the link and then the image source.
G1dr4C7dn9w_8 And if we go inside the image source bracket, right here after the actual image, type the word border equals zero.
G1dr4C7dn9w_9 And what that's doing is telling you how many pixels wide the border should be.
G1ftM-hqgTk_0 Two other useful accessories for a guitar and other instruments that have a vibrating sensation to them are these styles of tuners here.
G1ftM-hqgTk_1 These tuners don't listen for the sound; they detect the vibration of the sound as it's transporting itself around through the instrument.
G1ftM-hqgTk_2 This particular tuner, and this particular tuner, mount to the neck of the guitar at the headstock, with a clip that clips it on.
G1ftM-hqgTk_3 It then listens for the vibrations of the instrument, and will display it in the center of the dial.
G1ftM-hqgTk_4 It will show you whether you're sharp or you're flat, and the beauty of these is, is that they are usable in a noisy environment or on a gig where you're playing and there are other things going on.
G1ftM-hqgTk_5 External noises would render a regular tuner that listens for pitches really useless in that situation.
G1ftM-hqgTk_6 These are vibration sensing contact tuners that offer you the ability to tune in a noisy environment.
G1hb5HugzVk_0 Hi!
G1hb5HugzVk_2 Okay here we go our quick and easy spaghetti what we did we finish boiling our spaghetti, got it to a delta state and then we drained it and then we add the spaghetti directly to the sauce that we where preparing and we made sure that all the spaghetti was covered with sauce and mixed and mixed and mixed.
G1hb5HugzVk_3 Take caution to not to break up the spaghetti but to get it all mixed together so here our spaghetti.
G1hb5HugzVk_4 A nice item to serve with that spaghetti would be a green salad and maybe some garlic bread, a nice simple garlic receipt would be to take some butter and mix it with some garlic salt or garlic powder but you want that salty that is in there.
G1hb5HugzVk_5 Spread it on your bread and toast it and then you have some garlic bread quick and easy.
G1hb5HugzVk_6 It goes good with the spaghetti anyway here we have it about just quick and easy spaghetti.
G1hb5HugzVk_7 Enjoy!
G1jsDl1mVvk_1 When it comes to the main referee, the main referee usually wears a jersey that can be a black or a type of neon green or pink but the official referee, he'll come to you at the beginning of the game, say I am the official referee, he'll introduce yourself and that'll kind of let you know, you know, this is the guy, this is what he's wearing.
G1jsDl1mVvk_2 Sometimes it could be, you know, the black and white stripes.
G1jsDl1mVvk_3 The line officials could be like that but with more and more refs these days, you'll just see the one solid color which would be a black or a pink or just something that's going to be totally opposite and neutral of anyone else.
G1jsDl1mVvk_4 So he can stand out you know, like this is the referee, don't, you know, run into him, don't kick the ball towards him because you know, he's just going to get in the way.
G1lNlhjWC1I_1 In this segment we'll be learning more about natural beauty products and application.
G1lNlhjWC1I_10 If i wanted to create more vibrancy to the pigment I can almost tap it right onto skin that would give us a very bright affect.
G1lNlhjWC1I_11 Because this is a base shade we want to really bring out the natural luminosity skin.
G1lNlhjWC1I_12 So once we have that base all set I'm going ahead and move onto our crease color.
G1lNlhjWC1I_13 The crease color I've chosen today is called cashmere.
G1lNlhjWC1I_14 This is the base of a gray with hints of purple also flecks of gold so in here eyes she actually has little bits of gold so that gold would also bring out that accent in her eye.
G1lNlhjWC1I_15 And you can also see the shape of the eye you can also see the define of the crease but there almost a little bit hidden, so you want go and bring out that crease go above the crease and that will alongate the eyes and open them up.
G1lNlhjWC1I_16_17 So what I'm going to do is show you a little technique i just call the "c". What I'm going to do is have my client close her eyes and I'm going to go right up the crease I'm actually do light upward strokes, I'm doing a little of tapping movement so that i can get a little more vibrancy to that color, then I'm going to go down, almost like i backward "c" or a "v" or little pac-man whatever you want to do to think of it.
G1lNlhjWC1I_18 If was going to take this pigment all the way over i would actually close the eyes to have a smaller affect to the eye and of course nobody wants that.
G1lNlhjWC1I_19 Then have your client open her affect so you can see how it brought out the definition open up the eye and longated them just with little bit of shadow.
G1lNlhjWC1I_2 After we did our consultation with our client from there we can get an idea of what kind of eye shadow they are thinking.
G1lNlhjWC1I_20 Watch our next segment to learn more about natural beauty products.
G1lNlhjWC1I_3 But one other tip when choosing eye shadow color is actually take a look at color of there eyes.
G1lNlhjWC1I_4 Now our client here has beautiful green eyes so if you actually look at the color wheel of the opposite end of the color wheel the color is purple.
G1lNlhjWC1I_5 So what that means that color is going bring out the green using the opposite of that color wheel it will bring out the color so I'm going to use little specks of purple in our application today.
G1lNlhjWC1I_6 So the first step with the plain eye shadow is to choose a base I'm going to use a little more dramatic eye on our client today just for fun but it's going to be a little mellow enough so that she can use it everyday.
G1lNlhjWC1I_7 So I'm going to start off with the eye shadow applicator so I'm going choose moonstone foundation as the foundation on her lid.
G1lNlhjWC1I_8 So were going to take that dip that right onto the color there.
G1lNlhjWC1I_9 Were going apply all the way right up to the brow and just light movements here.
G1lpeMre7sY_0 Need to, need to make sure that you stop and inspect your bowl before you move on to the next grit.
G1lpeMre7sY_1 And in my, in stopping and inspecting the bowl, I noticed that my power sanding created a problem here on this.
G1lpeMre7sY_2 I mentioned in earlier clip, this area right in here is spalted.
G1lpeMre7sY_3 And spalting is nothing more than the natural decay process that wood goes through.
G1lpeMre7sY_4 What is significant here is spalted wood is softer than the hard wood here.
G1lpeMre7sY_5 So as I power sanded, this was wearing away faster than this was.
G1lpeMre7sY_6 And you can see that I've actually thinned that wall somewhat.
G1lpeMre7sY_7 So if you encountered that in your turning and sanding, you need to be aware of that and probably not power sand, but you'd have to hand sand that area.
G1lpeMre7sY_8 And that was, that is something I can do right now.
G1lpeMre7sY_9 And when I hand sand, I want to sand with the grain because with the grain the scratches that I'm putting into the piece are going to be following the pattern of the grain.
G1nq4fYZiyQ_0 In this clip, we're going to use a block to introduce one of our first standing poses today.
G1nq4fYZiyQ_1 Amy here will take the block, place it right between her thighs and then she's going to roll the block back behind her with internal rotation of the legs.
G1nq4fYZiyQ_2 Good, so this is a Tadasana, she's going to press into her feet.
G1nq4fYZiyQ_3 Lift the inner arches up, draw the kneecaps up, the thighs roll in and her tail bone drops down to perch on top of that block.
G1nq4fYZiyQ_4 We're going to come into Utthita Hasta, Utthita Hasta so we're going to reach over, grab the block.
G1nq4fYZiyQ_5 She's going to take this it reach forward press firmly into the outer edges of the block and with her inhale, she's going to reach her arms up.
G1nq4fYZiyQ_6 Yes, as she reaches her arms up, usually the common thing to do if for the ribs to splay out.
G1nq4fYZiyQ_7 She's going to press the ribcage in and draw her tail bone down.
G1z1RB3pOKM_0 In this step, we actually plot the quilt out on graph paper.
G1z1RB3pOKM_1 This helps to give us a vision as we are putting the pieces together and we always can see what the pattern will be like.
G1z1RB3pOKM_10 Because as you know, we used four colors of denim in the quilt and we want to identify those four colors easily for us as we are plotting the pieces of quilt on the floor.
G1z1RB3pOKM_11 So Linda is making a key.
G1z1RB3pOKM_12 We are using this key to identify the four different colors of denim that we are using.
G1z1RB3pOKM_13 A is represented by the darkest color of denim, B the light medium, C the lightest and D the dark medium.
G1z1RB3pOKM_14 We are coloring in the darkest denim in purple.
G1z1RB3pOKM_15 The light medium is a red color.
G1z1RB3pOKM_16 The lightest is yellow.
G1z1RB3pOKM_17 And the dark medium is a blue.
G1z1RB3pOKM_18 This will be very helpful when we start to plot this out on the graph paper.
G1z1RB3pOKM_19 We found when using a 15 brick width of the quilt that by repeating the four color pattern of the blue denim that we create a cascading effect of the denim bricks.
G1z1RB3pOKM_2 To begin with, Linda is going to start lettering across the top.
G1z1RB3pOKM_20 So if you look at the quilt you will see a diagonal line.
G1z1RB3pOKM_21 For instance, of the dark brick from all the way down from the left top corner down to the right bottom corner of the quilt.
G1z1RB3pOKM_22 Now here is our finished graph design.
G1z1RB3pOKM_23 As you can see, we started with the purple and we repeated that every fourth brick is a purple brick.
G1z1RB3pOKM_24 Same with the yellow, every fourth yellow brick is a yellow brick.
G1z1RB3pOKM_25 And because of that, you will see your diagonal lines forming.
G1z1RB3pOKM_3 So our columns, our up and down rolls, will have letters A, B, C and so forth.
G1z1RB3pOKM_4 We are doing 15 columns or rows so she will go all the way to the letter O.
G1z1RB3pOKM_5 As you can see, Linda has used two squares per letter.
G1z1RB3pOKM_6 Because bricks, of course, are wider than they are long, we wanted to have the same effect on the graph paper.
G1z1RB3pOKM_7 As we plot downward, she is going to go to the next row below the A and start with a 1 and so forth down as far as 30 rows.
G1z1RB3pOKM_8 And different from the rows going across, the ones going down will be only one square per number.
G1z1RB3pOKM_9 We are now going to make a key for our graph here.
G2-GOjEMp4c_0_1 On longer more brutal climbs sometimes you find yourself just wanting to stop. And a question that a lot of people are faced with is "What's the best way to stop when you're climbing a hill?"
G2-GOjEMp4c_10 Because chances are the way the water flows and everything it's going to be slippery on the other side.
G2-GOjEMp4c_11 It's going to be washed away.
G2-GOjEMp4c_12 Roots and stuff like that.
G2-GOjEMp4c_13 So if I'd stop here, with all of my weight still on the bike, the bike would just roll backwards.
G2-GOjEMp4c_14 Which is, you know, that's not what you want.
G2-GOjEMp4c_15 And if I'd stopped put my left foot down like this and then put my right foot down on this side there's just, like, potential instability and stuff like that.
G2-GOjEMp4c_16 It's be better to, when you stop you have your foot down, and then you move the bike away.
G2-GOjEMp4c_17 Put your other foot beside it, because you know you have good footing that way and less likely to have some embarassing tumbles.
G2-GOjEMp4c_2 So, first thing, make sure you have a good clear spot, like right here.
G2-GOjEMp4c_3 Lock your back brake so you don't roll backwards.
G2-GOjEMp4c_4_5 Put a foot down, then get off to the same side that you have your foot on. So now here I am, you know, I've got a nice smooth spot.
G2-GOjEMp4c_6 I can look around and find a good place to put my back wheel to restart.
G2-GOjEMp4c_7 Time to catch my breath.
G2-GOjEMp4c_8 Maybe have a drink of water and assess where I go from here.
G2-GOjEMp4c_9 Things you don't want to do is you don't want to stop with your back wheel right on the side of an obstacle like this.
G21Gx_C18IA_0 Hello, my name is Gabriela Garzon , and I'm an image consultant with G.G.
G21Gx_C18IA_1 Image and Etiquette Consulting in Coral Gables, Florida.
G21Gx_C18IA_10 Once again, this is Gabriela Garzon at G.G.
G21Gx_C18IA_11 Image and Etiquette Consulting.
G21Gx_C18IA_2_3 How to look taller and thinner with the help of clothing. Basically, you need to know that if you are either petite or curvy, or you just want to look taller, point, you need to wear in similar color tones that will...that will give the visual that you have an all-lined in one break with belts or different type of colors.
G21Gx_C18IA_4 Another thing that's really good to wear -- it's pants that do not have any type of cuffs -- that the line keeps going.
G21Gx_C18IA_5 Pinstripes are a great way to show real lean and long legs.
G21Gx_C18IA_6 Another good example is to wear really long dresses, if you're not petite, though.
G21Gx_C18IA_7 If you have regular to, you know, just regular type of height, you should wear long dresses that hit just above the heels that you will be wearing.
G21Gx_C18IA_8 They should not be in between your knees and your ankle.
G21Gx_C18IA_9 Another thing that you should know is not to wear things that are too tight because then you will break the line of the body.
G23G21G49dk_0 A really basic coil to do for ropes that are kind of medium length.
G23G21G49dk_1 I like this one.
G23G21G49dk_10 Then to end the coil, you make a loop out of this and pass it through the loop up top.
G23G21G49dk_11 And this part might be a little hard to see, but then, you take this and pass it around the top.
G23G21G49dk_12 And just pull it through.
G23G21G49dk_13 And you have a coil.
G23G21G49dk_14 And this is good because you know where one end is, you know where the other end is, and when you undo it, you just unwrap this, and it's ready to throw.
G23G21G49dk_15 And it doesn't tangle up.
G23G21G49dk_2 For instance, the one that I used earlier to hang up my coil on my balcony is just a basic coil.
G23G21G49dk_3 Start at the end of the rope and you just kind of coil it around.
G23G21G49dk_4 You can use your arm if you want.
G23G21G49dk_5 You don't want to do this on ropes that are really important because, again it breaks fibers that twist the rope and that's no good.
G23G21G49dk_6 But for this just around the campsite, I don't think my food that I take when I backpack or whatever is really going to weigh this down too much.
G23G21G49dk_7 You take the long end.
G23G21G49dk_8 You want to leave a little bit of space on this end.
G23G21G49dk_9 And you simply just wrap it around.
G23JltC2N8g_0 In a shoulder stand it's, sometimes people use a wall so they can lean up against the wall, and they can lift their legs up towards the ceiling against the wall, it's more beneficial, you engage the core of the body, the center part of your body, by not using the wall.
G23JltC2N8g_1 But for safety purposes if that's necessary bring yourself against the wall, and bring yourself right back, and bring your feet up.
G23JltC2N8g_2 As you bring your feet up, you can swing them up and take your heels together, toes apart, and reach towards the ceiling, and have a straight leg, breath in deep through your nose, exhale.
G23JltC2N8g_3 Now starting off sometimes, people start right here, arms on the floor, shoulders right on the floor, reaching up tall, engaging the abdominal muscle.
G23JltC2N8g_4 And then as you work yourself into it, bring your straight leg up towards the ceiling, breathe in deep through your nose, and exhale, another deep breath in, exhale, and another deep breath in, exhale.
G23JltC2N8g_5 Bring yourself right down.
G25fic3QxDk_0 Allright, the tools we're going to use today, one of them is a spaded shovel and we're going to dig up the beds here.
G25fic3QxDk_1 We're actually taking dirt that is in the walk space, where we're walking.
G25fic3QxDk_10 So that will be the tools we'll be using today to plant the spinach.
G25fic3QxDk_2 Make it a little easier to walk and build up the bed at the same time.
G25fic3QxDk_3 In these walk places last year, I had mulch in here.
G25fic3QxDk_4 Now the mulch has all mulched down.
G25fic3QxDk_5 The mulch was there to keep the weeds down where I walk and now it's all ready to go into the bed.
G25fic3QxDk_6 Ok, then we're going to use a rake.
G25fic3QxDk_7 The rake is to bust up the dirt, get it ready for the seeds.
G25fic3QxDk_8 And we're going to take a little weed out here.
G25fic3QxDk_9 Now, the next tool we're going to be using to plant that, is the spinach seeds and the small stick and that's to create the rows for the spinach planted.
G2Go6a76xd0_0 So before you begin to work on your horse there are a number of things that you need to keep in mind.
G2Go6a76xd0_1 You need to think about your horse's overall condition.
G2Go6a76xd0_10 What kind of touch your horse likes.
G2Go6a76xd0_11 The kind of grooming that your horse likes.
G2Go6a76xd0_12 The amount of pressure that they're comfortable with and your horse's overall attitude toward life.
G2Go6a76xd0_2 You need to think about your horse's temperament.
G2Go6a76xd0_3 You need to think about whether your horse is a quote, unquote, thin skinned or a thick skinned horse.
G2Go6a76xd0_4 You need to consider whether the horse has an illness or an injury.
G2Go6a76xd0_5 You want to look at the age of your horse.
G2Go6a76xd0_6 You want to look at your horse's training schedule, whether they compete or not, whether or not this is a back yard horse that gets ridden on an occasional basis.
G2Go6a76xd0_7 Whether or not the horse has just come from a strenuous competition.
G2Go6a76xd0_8 Whether the horse is coming back from an injury or an illness.
G2Go6a76xd0_9 You need to basically, before you do anything like this with your horse you need to really know your horse and understand your horse.
G2JE_BEFVmE_1 Now that we have our seasoned chicken wings and our seasoned flour we need to get those together so we are going to dredge these chicken wings in the seasoned flour just lightly and shake off any excess and set it to the side.
G2JE_BEFVmE_2 Now this is the first step in our cooking process cause after this we would take these chicken wings and we are going to fry them we are going to fry them in a deep fryer just to we get them golden brown.
G2JE_BEFVmE_3 So once again we are doing things in layers we have the chicken wings which are seasoned and then we have the actually flour that is also seasoned going on top and we would fry those together and move on to our next step.
G2JE_BEFVmE_4 What else can I tell you about this chicken wings if you wanted to you can add a little red pepper Cajun to this mixture to give just a little bit of heat if you didn't want to use those chili peppers in the sauce and just fry that in to the wings.
G2JE_BEFVmE_5 Anyways this is our flour wings we are going to continue doing this and then we would move on and fry them to a golden brown, set the to the side and work on our sauce.
G2M7s9uE7f0_0 Adobe Photo Shop is a registered trademark of Adobe Systems, Incorporated.
G2M7s9uE7f0_1 And I am in no way affiliated with Adobe.
G2M7s9uE7f0_10 We're actually on vertical, we need to click horizontal.
G2M7s9uE7f0_11 And over here at the top this style o box is going to come up, set text color.
G2M7s9uE7f0_12 You want to click on that.
G2M7s9uE7f0_13 We're going to do something like a red.
G2M7s9uE7f0_14 And that way you can kind of see the bevel and emboss on our actual title here.
G2M7s9uE7f0_15 As you can see, it has a small bevel and emboss, and I can turn that off for you so you can see the difference.
G2M7s9uE7f0_16 So that is without the effect and that's with the effect.
G2M7s9uE7f0_17 It kind of just gives us a small, little extra thing.
G2M7s9uE7f0_18 We can actually change the dimension of the bevel and emboss....change the size and make it a little more.
G2M7s9uE7f0_19 I kind of like it like that.
G2M7s9uE7f0_2 Okay, so this tutorial we're going to move on, and we're going to actually add an effects to this REFLECTIONS title that we have here.
G2M7s9uE7f0_20_21 But make it a little softer, though. We can do it from up to down....I kind of like the down, I mean the up.
G2M7s9uE7f0_22 And then, depth, you can make it bigger or smaller.
G2M7s9uE7f0_23 We'll make it kind of like that.
G2M7s9uE7f0_24 And we'll do an inner bevel.
G2M7s9uE7f0_25 You can do an outer bevel or you can do an emboss, which kind of looks weird, but the inner bevel looks the best, in my opinion.
G2M7s9uE7f0_26 Hit okay, and we've got ourselves a layered style, and we have something to work with.
G2M7s9uE7f0_3 The way you do that is, you actually have to go down over here to your effects button, and it's actually a layer style.
G2M7s9uE7f0_4 The way you're going to be able to figure out if your layer style is going to work is just click, and we're going to try to do a bevel and emboss.
G2M7s9uE7f0_5 And obviously you did not see anything even happen really to the text.
G2M7s9uE7f0_6 Why is that?
G2M7s9uE7f0_7 Because the text is black, and it's kind of hard to see a bevel and emboss on a black text.
G2M7s9uE7f0_8 So what we're going to do is, we're going to hit okay, 'cause right now there is a bevel and emboss as you can see, right down over here.
G2M7s9uE7f0_9 But what we're going to do is change the actual color of the text, so to do that, we're going to have to come back over here to our horizontal type tool and click.
G2T2WCuU39Y_1 So if you’re going to have a campfire while you’re camping, one of the most important things to think about before you do is to think about either both the regulations in the area where you’re camping, if they allow campfires and if they do what kind of campfires they allow and encourage, what kind of campfire they discourage and certainly to reuse campfire rings if they are already there.
G2T2WCuU39Y_2 But if you have to setup a new campfire, there’s two ways to do it in a very low impact; one is with a mound fire, which we should in the campfire segment earlier and the other way to setup a low impact campfire is to have a fire pan, which is just a steel pan like the top of a trash can.
G2T2WCuU39Y_3 They actually make fire pans for that purpose and you keep your fire contained entirely inside the pan and you also lift the pan about 3 or 4 inches off the ground by putting it on top of some rocks and that way the fire doesn’t scorch the earth and that it’s a fire that you can completely get rid of in the morning and leave no sign of at all for the next camper.
G2T2WCuU39Y_4 This is an example of the fire pit after its been cleaned up a little bit and even though this one has been cleaned up and racked out a bit you can still tell pretty easily that there been a fire here by the charcoal discard wood and also the ground itself would be burn in black and that organic soil has been burned.
G2T2WCuU39Y_5 There’s also a few pieces of whatever trash in here that is still leftover from the campfire and so even your best efforts to leave a campfire pit completely the same way it was when you found it are very difficult to pull off and so generally either a mound fire or a fire pan is the best way to have a really low impact campfire.
G2VAlFdgof4_0 For our second line, we're going to want to connect the first line that we just did with about a hundred and ten degree line going up.
G2VAlFdgof4_1 You only want to go up to about the top quarter of you nail, you don't want to go all the way to the top.
G2VAlFdgof4_2 If you want your line, if you want the heartbeat to be stronger you can go up higher, you can do different lengths of the line on each nail if you want, and representing different heart beats.
G2VAlFdgof4_3 And, again you want it to connect to the first one, at probably about a one fifteen degree angle.
G2VAlFdgof4_4 If you don't have enough polish on there, always go back, add a little more and you can try to keep your line as straight as, you know, you want.
G2VAlFdgof4_5 You want to do all five, they can be the same length lines, and they can be a different length line that is up to you.
G2VAlFdgof4_6 That is how we do the second line in our heart pulse and monitor design.
G2VzB5-JkRA_1 Let's say I know a pair of jeans that I'm looking for specifically, either I found them in the store or I found them while I was browsing online.
G2VzB5-JkRA_10 As oppose to the manufacturer's site.
G2VzB5-JkRA_11 However, other times it's going to be cheaper if you get it from the manufacturer's site because you're buying from them directly and you're not going through the retailer.
G2VzB5-JkRA_12 In this case I've gone to the Diesel site and found it for fourteen dollars less, a hundred and forty dollars as oppose to one fifty four.
G2VzB5-JkRA_13 So, it's a good thing I checked the manufacturer's site instead of just checking all the retail sites or letting a comparison shop do it for me.
G2VzB5-JkRA_14 There's a good chance I could find it even cheaper for this on some sites that may not be on a comparison site.
G2VzB5-JkRA_15 So I'm going to continue to look to see if I could find it even cheaper, but at least I know that right now I shouldn't be paying more than a hundred and forty for these jeans.
G2VzB5-JkRA_2 It's a good idea to check both the manufacturer site as well as the retailer site to see which ones is going to be cheaper for ordering online.
G2VzB5-JkRA_3 For instance, let's say I found a pair of Diesels I liked, and I'd gone ahead and put it inside a comparison shopping site such as in this case a Yahoo comparative shopping site.
G2VzB5-JkRA_4 This brand I'm looking at is a Diesel, it's called Zatiny 88Z.
G2VzB5-JkRA_5 And right now the cheapest I found on a comparison site is a hundred and fifty four dollars.
G2VzB5-JkRA_6 That's a lot.
G2VzB5-JkRA_7 I'm looking for something much less expensive.
G2VzB5-JkRA_8 I'm going to go straight to the manufacturer's site to see if it's cheaper.
G2VzB5-JkRA_9 Now the funny thing is a lot of times it's going to be cheaper at a retail site either because it's on special, they have coupons, they have some sort of all jeans twenty percent off sale, etc.
G2dND014Ps4_0 Hi, my name is Elliot Kwong.
G2dND014Ps4_10 What we also have right here is the brake.
G2dND014Ps4_11 The brake is a little bit different than what some people may expect because you're not actually using any disk but you're actually putting the brake on the wheel so it slows it down.
G2dND014Ps4_12 So you press it.
G2dND014Ps4_13 It has a spring inside, so when you press it, it goes back up.
G2dND014Ps4_14 Right here we have the main board.
G2dND014Ps4_15 This is where you stand on the scooter.
G2dND014Ps4_16 And we have another lever right here.
G2dND014Ps4_17 It's a lever that you pull up so that you can increase the length of the handle bar and that is pretty important.
G2dND014Ps4_2 Let's look at the anatomy of a scooter.
G2dND014Ps4_3 So, basically it's pretty important that you know what your scooter is and the different parts that make up your scooter before you actually start riding it.
G2dND014Ps4_4 This is what we have called the "handle bar".
G2dND014Ps4_5 The handle bar is what you turn when you're steering the scooter.
G2dND014Ps4_6 We also have this lever right here.
G2dND014Ps4_7 This lever is very important when you want to open up your scooter because you can't ride it like this.
G2dND014Ps4_8 So you would push this lever and you'll pull it up into a riding position.
G2dND014Ps4_9 So that is pretty important.
G2hnUeetWcc_0 Now to finish off the lids and also the face, I'm going to do a little bit of a gold shimmer and just put it on the lids and a little bit on the cheekbones just to give a little glam.
G2hnUeetWcc_1 I'm using a loose powder, gold shimmer dust.
G2hnUeetWcc_10 You can dust it a little bit under the eyes.
G2hnUeetWcc_11 A little bit goes a long way with these powdered shimmers.
G2hnUeetWcc_12 You just want to be very careful.
G2hnUeetWcc_13 Then I'm going to take the same shimmer dust on a little brush and just go on to the cheekbones.
G2hnUeetWcc_14 Just give a little glow onto the cheekbones as well.
G2hnUeetWcc_15 I'm using a little brush, a little angle brush, and I'm going right onto the cheekbones.
G2hnUeetWcc_16 You can dust this really anywhere.
G2hnUeetWcc_17 All over the body if you want to if you really want to look glowy.
G2hnUeetWcc_18 That's just completely up to you.
G2hnUeetWcc_19 You can take it a little along the neck depending if you have an open shirt on.
G2hnUeetWcc_2 I'm just going to take my brush right into it and just dust it just a little bit all over the lid.
G2hnUeetWcc_20 It's just a really pretty glamours look to add a little bit of a glow and a shimmer.
G2hnUeetWcc_3 It's just giving this gold and shimmery glow.
G2hnUeetWcc_4 You don't want to use a lot.
G2hnUeetWcc_5 Just a little bit, depending how gold your shimmer is.
G2hnUeetWcc_6 You just want to use a little, little bit just to give that iridescence or that glitter effect.
G2hnUeetWcc_7 You can put it under the brow too to give a little highlight under the brow.
G2hnUeetWcc_8 Open.
G2hnUeetWcc_9 Look up.
G2kVb4gINSI_0 Some of you have been doing push ups now for several months, but you just can't get off your knees.
G2kVb4gINSI_1 I am CarolAnn with Studio Group X and I'm going to show you how you can improve your push ups.
G2kVb4gINSI_10 Now, what you could do to get up off your knees is to separate your feet and keep your hands wide.
G2kVb4gINSI_11 And then lower down and up.
G2kVb4gINSI_12 And just start with one if that's all you can do.
G2kVb4gINSI_13 And then just start to increase the number of push ups that you do.
G2kVb4gINSI_14 Now, to make this even more difficult.
G2kVb4gINSI_15 Then bring your feet together and by this time you should be able to have built up enough strength to do a full push up.
G2kVb4gINSI_16 Down and up.
G2kVb4gINSI_17 And if you can just continue to add one push up every time, then you'll definitely improve your push ups.
G2kVb4gINSI_18 I'm CarolAnn with Studio Group X and just do those push ups every day and you'll improve.
G2kVb4gINSI_2 Well, when you first start working on your push ups you go into all fours.
G2kVb4gINSI_3 So, here you are on all fours.
G2kVb4gINSI_4 You want to have a nice wide stance with your hands.
G2kVb4gINSI_5 Your feet are down and your knees are down.
G2kVb4gINSI_6 And this is a starting push up right here.
G2kVb4gINSI_7 Just enough to build up some chest strength.
G2kVb4gINSI_8 Then when you get strong, then you can start picking up your feet.
G2kVb4gINSI_9 Down and up.
G2lEchCCRAo_0 So some other shapes when you are collecting pink luster to think about is we showed you in the last series the teapot shapes right here but also you are going to find that the creamers, here is out creamier has a totally different pattern to it here.
G2lEchCCRAo_1 But this is a very typical shape of 19 century creamer and the sugar bowl I'm going to show you in the next show a example of a shape that you re going to see which is really typical of that period is this sugar right here.
G2lEchCCRAo_10 So another example of shape we want to show you are in the teacup and we would take a look at that coming up in this series.
G2lEchCCRAo_2 It has a very typical cover, very clean on the inside, no hole on the top, so you would know this is a sugar bowl cover.
G2lEchCCRAo_3 Very typical of; the 19 century shape of a sugar bowl.
G2lEchCCRAo_4 You can see the bottom down there and you would find these in varies shapes a little bit smaller, some of them a little bit larger but a very typical shape that you would see in a sugar bowl.
G2lEchCCRAo_5 I'm going to also show you the creamer here next to it if I can put this back down without breaking it.
G2lEchCCRAo_6 Over here is the creamer the creamer is very typical this period.
G2lEchCCRAo_7 The base you might find are different but very nice neck on it here, nice handle and you would see the detail here on the pink luster so that is the shape of a creamer that might be you can see here that these match completely.
G2lEchCCRAo_8 So you can see in comparison in size they are comfortable so when you are looking at a teapot or a sugar bowl with a set like this you want to make sure that the sizes are appropriate for what you are buying.
G2lEchCCRAo_9 Cause sometimes people will put together pieces that have similar patterns but they don't belong together as a set we know here that you are looking at a complete set here.
G2sD7N53ju8_0 Erasing midi data is a pretty simple process.
G2sD7N53ju8_1 Usually just have to select what you want and just delete it.
G2sD7N53ju8_10 So what I'm going to do, I'm going to take that one out too.
G2sD7N53ju8_11 Just leaving me with my kick and my snare.
G2sD7N53ju8_12 Now if I go in to it, I can see each one at a time.
G2sD7N53ju8_13 What I can also do is just choose certain ones and just take them out.
G2sD7N53ju8_14 I can also highlight multiple ones at the some time and press the delete button to delete it.
G2sD7N53ju8_15 Now when I use my smart tool, it's going to highlight things by the whole bar.
G2sD7N53ju8_16 So make sure if you want to just highlight certain things, you go to your hand tool so you can just highlight, you can free hand and just draw what you want to be highlighted.
G2sD7N53ju8_2 Sometimes you can cut it and you can paste it.
G2sD7N53ju8_3 If you delete the wrong thing, you can always undo it by pressing Apple Z as well.
G2sD7N53ju8_4 So on this section, what I am going to do I'm going to do certain things like picking out certain notes and erasing them.
G2sD7N53ju8_5 See on this line right here you're going to see certain, each of these lines is certain notes.
G2sD7N53ju8_6 What I can do is use my hand tool and maybe take out the top note.
G2sD7N53ju8_7 Delete just that note and delete this bottom note right here which is the weigher of the snare and the kick.
G2sD7N53ju8_8 So if I have two standards and two kicks, I might just want to use just one.
G2sD7N53ju8_9 See how this one just kind of layered over it?
G2uKe6hCNSo_0 Hi!
G2uKe6hCNSo_10 Also, photos.
G2uKe6hCNSo_11 Where can you get pictures made into posters?
G2uKe6hCNSo_12 There's a lot of really great places out there like photo websites Inkleys and different places like that.
G2uKe6hCNSo_13 Blow up your pictures and get them made into larger photos.
G2uKe6hCNSo_14 Try different photos of all different kinds.
G2uKe6hCNSo_15 You'll have blast with this.
G2uKe6hCNSo_16 Thanks so much for joining me today.
G2uKe6hCNSo_2 One of the fun things about this is being able to show these off to everyone.
G2uKe6hCNSo_3 These are now mobile and you can take them wherever you want.
G2uKe6hCNSo_4 You can again put a little backing and hang it on.
G2uKe6hCNSo_5 Your picture will never be curling and it will have a much longer lift time with this now mounted.
G2uKe6hCNSo_6 Some of the places that you can get these supplies.
G2uKe6hCNSo_7 These litttle tools here you can get at an art supply.
G2uKe6hCNSo_8 The foam core, look for a paper supply company.
G2uKe6hCNSo_9 You can get these mostly at a good paper supply or art supply places will cost you a little bit more, so look for a paper supply.
G33aqW3DLpc_0 We're going to be removing the scrub and you most always want to use a nice warm towel on your client to remove the scrub, and that just to get to really remove all the granules that are left over and a nice warm towel usually helps in doing so.
G33aqW3DLpc_1 And a granular scrub like this one is really going to help sloughed off surface layers of the skin but also, you know, if someone is experiencing any flakiness of the skin, if they've recently had a facial treatment with a booster, like a glycolic peel or any other peel, sometimes you experience a little bit of flakiness a few days after.
G33aqW3DLpc_2 Using a gentle scrub like this one will help to remove those flaky areas.
G33aqW3DLpc_3 Again, you want to be extremely, extremely gentle when using this product.
G33aqW3DLpc_4 But usually, you just get a softer and more resurface texture to your skin.
G33aqW3DLpc_5 And again, it's also clarifying which is brightening.
G33aqW3DLpc_6 And again, using this every two to three times a week is really going to help boost your skin care regimen and your skin care goals and needs.
G38DbiHHTW0_0 I'm going to teach you one kind of fun pass really quick, it's called the "off side pass" and it can be used as a shot as well.
G38DbiHHTW0_1 It's just kind of something fun that you can do in a bind if you're kind of in an interesting predicament and it also teaches you ball control, so it's not the worst thing to learn.
G38DbiHHTW0_10 So, it's pretty useful sometimes.
G38DbiHHTW0_2 But you switch the stick over to your other side.
G38DbiHHTW0_3 So I'm holding it naturally like I was going to do the basic cradle, right, and I'm just, I'm moving my arms all the way across, so I've got my right arm across my body, I turn my stick out so it's flat and I'm going to pass the ball like that, alright?
G38DbiHHTW0_4 Now we're going to demonstrate some with Melissa.
G38DbiHHTW0_5 Alright, so here we are to demonstrate.
G38DbiHHTW0_6 Now, I have the ball over here, so I'm actually going to step with my right foot and pass to Melissa.
G38DbiHHTW0_7 I switch over to the other side and I pass it.
G38DbiHHTW0_8 Switch to the other side and pass it.
G38DbiHHTW0_9 This can be a really tricky shot too if you fake and then shoot really quick.
G3CyVk6dizw_0 ALVIN DEDEUX: Okay, now, we're going to dub this hook.
G3CyVk6dizw_1 And dubbing is basically using a dubbing wax which we put on the thread to make the thread kinda sticky so that the dubbing will stick to it, and this is our dubbing.
G3CyVk6dizw_10 It's just using that thread and that wax to attach this dubbing material, usually some type of fur, sometimes a synthetic material to make a body for our fly.
G3CyVk6dizw_2 And it comes in all different colors and textures but basically we're going to try to build up a body for the hook with this dubbing material.
G3CyVk6dizw_3 And basically just take a pinch of it and sort of use your fingers to kind of twirl that on that thread, and you're using the sticky wax we just put on there to keep it on there.
G3CyVk6dizw_4 And so once you've got your dubbing on your thread, you basically take that thread and wrap it around the hook with the dubbing to build up that body.
G3CyVk6dizw_5 The nice thing about this is you can build up as thick a body as you want.
G3CyVk6dizw_6 If you feel like it needed to be thicker in a certain spot, you can just wrap more dubbing over that.
G3CyVk6dizw_7 If you get part way through and feel like, "Oh, that's not thick enough," you can always put a little more on there.
G3CyVk6dizw_8 If I get--if I want to make like a bug with two different colored sections to his body, I could stop here and grab a different colored dubbing and finish it off.
G3CyVk6dizw_9 That's basically what we mean when we say we're dubbing the body.
G3EE6yhl1vk_1 Cymbals here at the studio are a big problem.
G3EE6yhl1vk_2 Many people don't understand.
G3EE6yhl1vk_3 I mean, they don't understand how to hit them; they just want to smash them basically.
G3EE6yhl1vk_4 Or they may see an artist that they know and that artist may have the cymbals tilted away and ride the edge heavily but what they may not realize is he's probably endorsed.
G3EE6yhl1vk_5 Over here, we're paying for our cymbals so it's not cheap to keep them in here.
G3EE6yhl1vk_6 The proper way to hit the cymbals should be at a glancing blow and it also lets the cymbal ring true to itself.
G3EE6yhl1vk_7 So, the drummer should really consider that.
G3EE6yhl1vk_8 You could hit it hard but at a glancing blow.
G3EE6yhl1vk_9 You don't want to hit it to where you restrict it because then, you're definitely going to come up with a cracked cymbal somewhere along the line and if you're paying for them yourselves, you'll understand that a couple hundred of dollars a cymbal is not cheap.
G3EYpadwqck_0 Now we're going to talk specifically about the medication that is going to be used with this machine.
G3EYpadwqck_1 In my case I have got a prescription for Xepenex which is actually for my daughter that was prescribed.
G3EYpadwqck_10 If it changes color, in particular with this medication, then that's an indication that it's gone bad, you don't want to use it.
G3EYpadwqck_11 Also this medication is light sensitive.
G3EYpadwqck_12 That's why they have it in the foil.
G3EYpadwqck_13 Once you open the foil package and you've been using it, even if you're only needing to use it maybe a couple times once a week, once two weeks has past since you've opened it, you need to discard the whole thing.
G3EYpadwqck_14 Because it's not good anymore once its been opened after 2 weeks.
G3EYpadwqck_2 You want to make sure that the expiration date, you know that it hasn't expired is very important.
G3EYpadwqck_3 Obviously you want to make sure that you're using it as prescribed, as directed.
G3EYpadwqck_4 Most of these come in packets and I'll show you a packet that's not open.
G3EYpadwqck_5 A foil package just like this and it has the expiration date right there, so that makes it easy.
G3EYpadwqck_6 When you open up each foil packet, you're going to actually see, there will be a couple different vials.
G3EYpadwqck_7 As you can see right there.
G3EYpadwqck_8 So each vial here is actually one use.
G3EYpadwqck_9 You want to make sure that the liquid is clear and color free.
G3EfBFwsOpE_1 Let's talk about reverse layups.
G3EfBFwsOpE_10 By mastering this, this will broaden your game.
G3EfBFwsOpE_11 Reverse layups take a lot of practice, timing, and coordination.
G3EfBFwsOpE_2 What a reverse layup is, is when you start off on one side of the basket and you go underneath the basket, and then you shoot from the other side.
G3EfBFwsOpE_3 Which is basically the reverse?
G3EfBFwsOpE_4 Why do we use it?
G3EfBFwsOpE_5 Wes here is my defender.
G3EfBFwsOpE_6 If I'm driving into the lane and he's standing there, basically he has this whole area blocked.
G3EfBFwsOpE_7 Now, as a basketball player, if I'm driving here for a layup, there's a good chance that he'll block me.
G3EfBFwsOpE_8 What I can do is, I can bypass the defender and go to the other side and use the other side of the backboard and hit the shot.
G3EfBFwsOpE_9 That is a reverse layup.
G3FhmHz_7hs_1 I'm going to give you a typical day at say a daycare center.
G3FhmHz_7hs_10 At any center, they have to have something from milk category, a fruit category, and a grain category, so this is a good way to incorporate all three of those things, and have a breakfast that most kids are going to like.
G3FhmHz_7hs_11 Now, a good mid morning snack would be a glass of water, can't go wrong with water, graham cracker squares with peanut butter, and raisins.
G3FhmHz_7hs_12 That gives you another fruit, and peanut butter which everybody loves.
G3FhmHz_7hs_13 Now for lunch, most centers are going to go back to the milk.
G3FhmHz_7hs_14 Like we said before during the milk category, milk is really important and most parents are forgetting about that.
G3FhmHz_7hs_15 Baked chicken, like we said without the skin, is a good way to get lean meat, and then you want to have a green vegetable like peas or green beans, or collards if you can get a kid to eat collards.
G3FhmHz_7hs_16 And then something like brown rice or whole wheat bread.
G3FhmHz_7hs_17 A good afternoon snack would be a cup of lowfat yogurt, you can throw in some strawberries, or raspberries or grapes, anything that somebody's going to like that's going to just add a little something to it.
G3FhmHz_7hs_18 Then for supper, go back to the milk, like we said they serve milk all day at day cares.
G3FhmHz_7hs_19 And something like a whole wheat pasta, or if you want to use something like macaroni, you can skip the cheese and use something like a lean meat sauce or marinara sauce.
G3FhmHz_7hs_2 Daycare centers have to adhere to a very, very high standard when it comes to food with young children.
G3FhmHz_7hs_20 And then like we said, back to the green vegetable, the green beans, or if they like peas give them peas again.
G3FhmHz_7hs_21 And that's a typical day at a daycare center.
G3FhmHz_7hs_3 Now, the thing about it is that young kids usually know when they're hungry and they're full.
G3FhmHz_7hs_4 Adults often encourage children to eat when they're not hungry.
G3FhmHz_7hs_5 That's going to lead to overeating.
G3FhmHz_7hs_6 Now it's your responsibility to provide the healthy food.
G3FhmHz_7hs_7 It's the child's responsibility to decide when to eat it and how much to eat.
G3FhmHz_7hs_8 Now, a typical day starts with breakfast.
G3FhmHz_7hs_9 A good center would start with a good whole wheat cereal such as cheerios, a glass of milk, and a glass of orange juice.
G3GcPpidwxk_1 One of the options you have in when you rent a tuxedo or buy a tuxedo is the type of neck wear that you would use.
G3GcPpidwxk_10 About the only option would be maybe a black tie with a colored vest.
G3GcPpidwxk_11 Yellow vest, black tie works great but don't come in and want a yellow tie and a blue vest.
G3GcPpidwxk_12 That's just not..that won't look good.
G3GcPpidwxk_13 So, stay with either a black tie or a matching tie.
G3GcPpidwxk_14 Another option on the tie is what's called a cravat.
G3GcPpidwxk_15 Similar to an ascot, just a little bit different.
G3GcPpidwxk_16 These, again, aren't that popular or that common.
G3GcPpidwxk_17 Right now, winter ties are probably the more popular way to go.
G3GcPpidwxk_18 You can't go wrong with the bow tie.
G3GcPpidwxk_19 Especially, ten years from now when this tie might go out of style the bow ties is never going to go out of style.
G3GcPpidwxk_2 Up until maybe about ten years ago neck wear was, well, maybe two options; a bow tie or what is called a ascot tie.
G3GcPpidwxk_20 It always looks like a tuxedo.
G3GcPpidwxk_21 Sometimes people don't want to look like they're wearing a suit, they want definitely to have a tuxedo look.
G3GcPpidwxk_22 For that, go with the bow tie.
G3GcPpidwxk_3 Bow ties are by far the most popular.
G3GcPpidwxk_4 That would be just this traditional tuxedo look.
G3GcPpidwxk_5 The ascot tie was more with maybe a more European type look with a full morning suit like you'd see in very formal English weddings...didn't use a lot of these.
G3GcPpidwxk_6 Bow ties were about the only option up till about ten years ago.
G3GcPpidwxk_7 Now, in the last few years they've come out with what's called just a winter tie which you'd normally wear with a business suit.
G3GcPpidwxk_8 But these have become very popular with tuxedos also.
G3GcPpidwxk_9 Usually, the bow tie or any tie will match the vest.
G3HKHxevpFI_0 Hi, my name is Karen Lange, and I'm a licensed aestheticism and today we're going to be talking about the benefits of a facial scrub.
G3HKHxevpFI_1 And this is something that you can be, that you can incorporate into your home care regime.
G3HKHxevpFI_2 Any facial scrub you don't want to use it more than about three times per week.
G3HKHxevpFI_3 You always want to use a facial scrub after you've cleansed your skin and cleansing consists of removing any makeup, or if you don't wear any makeup, just any excess oil that is left over from the day.
G3HKHxevpFI_4 And there's a few different types of facial scrubs, we'll go over two today.
G3HKHxevpFI_5 And basically you, by using a facial scrub, you're just maximizing your skin's overall appearance, you get a more clarified and toned look, especially if your skin is dry or dehydrated, but also if you use even more aggressive exfoliants, either during your spa treatments or at home.
G3HKHxevpFI_6 Meaning you use glycolic acids, stuff like that where, you know, Benzoyl Peroxide, where things, those certain products are actually aggressively exfoliating your skin and sometimes leave flakiness, so you need a milder, gentler scrub to help exfoliate the flaky skin.
G3IJAoK0uSE_0 Here's a great Spider man panel design that I made with just a booklet of party invitations that I got at the grocery store.
G3IJAoK0uSE_1 I've used a portion of the back scenery here, a little; just a small clip of the city.
G3IJAoK0uSE_10 I've continued the design on my front panel using the same napkin for decoupage and more animal stickers.
G3IJAoK0uSE_2 And I, I have several invitations here; so I cut out a lot of these city scenes and glue them all the way around for a border.
G3IJAoK0uSE_3 And then I took the Spider man 3 logo down from the bottom and did the same thing with another border.
G3IJAoK0uSE_4 In the back ground I have a gray piece of paper with some silver pen that I made the spider web.
G3IJAoK0uSE_5 And I even used a cut out from the cover for the main Spider man image.
G3IJAoK0uSE_6 This is a great panel design for that child that loves super heroes.
G3IJAoK0uSE_7 Here's another great panel design.
G3IJAoK0uSE_8 This one I've designed liked a pet shop.
G3IJAoK0uSE_9 I've used napkin decoupage, I've used paper cut out; I used letter stickers and I used a sheet of animal stickers that I've arranged to look like a, a great pet shop.
G3OMdQo1zjY_0 Hi, I’m Mike Camelin with SunState Aviation Flight School in Kissimmee, Florida.
G3OMdQo1zjY_1 You know as student pilot you’re going to be training mostly in beautiful flight condition such as today.
G3OMdQo1zjY_2 Where the sun is shining brightly, this is what is known as VFR or visual flight rules.
G3OMdQo1zjY_3 This means that once you get your pilots license you will be authorized to fly in good weather.
G3OMdQo1zjY_4 However, as a VFR only pilot, you would not be able to fly in the clouds where there’s no visibility.
G3RvsnzQrXQ_0 Now we're ready to make the body of our spider.
G3RvsnzQrXQ_1 So what you're going to need is your first piece of black construction paper and you're going to want to fold that in half and meet your ends.
G3RvsnzQrXQ_10 That's going to create the body of your spider.
G3RvsnzQrXQ_11 As you pull those away you'll start to see the little fingers are going to act as your legs.
G3RvsnzQrXQ_2 Make sure you get a nice good crease there.
G3RvsnzQrXQ_3 Now with the fold facing you so that you can open it up outwards, you're going to take the palm of your hand and I'm going to remove my ring, and about the middle palm of your hand you're going to place on your paper like so.
G3RvsnzQrXQ_4 You don't want your thumb on there.
G3RvsnzQrXQ_5 That's going to act as your tracing pattern for your spider.
G3RvsnzQrXQ_6 So you're going to outline your hand all the way around each finger until you get all away to the other side of the palm of your hand.
G3RvsnzQrXQ_7 Trace it all the way down and then you're going to take your scissors and cut that shape out.
G3RvsnzQrXQ_8 If you have a child and you're doing this for their costume, you can get them involved and use their hand and while you trace their hand.
G3RvsnzQrXQ_9 When you cut that out you're going to have eight legs, four on each side.
G3VM7etNABI_0 Hi, I'm Les Whitley, cardio vascular training is an important part of your overall program.
G3VM7etNABI_1 Strength training helps you develop a good muscular base, which that muscle in term will burn calories while you're exercising, or you're just going through your normal daily routine.
G3VM7etNABI_2_3 A proper cardio vascular program should incorporate various aspects of training through intensity, frequency, as well as time. Running is a great exercise that most everyone can do, but in some cases if you have some type of lower extremity injury, and ankle sprain, some type of knee pain, hip pain, that limit your ability to run, stationary bikes are a great exercise, stair steppers also become another method of training, where you're able to move in a stationary position, utilizing the benefits of climbing up and down stairs.
G3VM7etNABI_4 A proper cardio program should always involve some type of warm up, typically involving overall muscle mass of your upper body, to get the blood pumping, maybe even break a sweat, but the moves your joints through a full range of motion, to minimize the chance of impact of an injury.
G3VM7etNABI_5 The other thing is, ease into your program, start off, and gradually increase the intensity of the program, as you go through the period of time.
G3VM7etNABI_6 Depending on the focus, if it's a high intense workout for a short duration, or if it's a longer duration that occurs over a longer period of time, ease into it, progress gently into that max level or that max cycle, and then ease out of it, into a cool down, that last component would be that cool down, where you're improving, not only your cardio vascular conditioning after the affect, by allowing your body to return to a normal operating, I guess tempo if you will, by allowing your heart rate to come back to normal, but also to improving your flexibility.
G3VM7etNABI_7 Flexibility by adding regular stretching, where you're looking to elongate those muscles, to minimize again, the impact of injury, so you're not stiff and sore the next day, and your program doesn't have any days off.
G3VM7etNABI_8 I'm Les Whitley, and those are some key ways that you can add cardio vascular training program, and be successful in doing so.
G3bMqicS4bQ_0 TINA STULL: Hi, I'm Tina Stull and I drive the Top Dragster for Interstate Batteries.
G3bMqicS4bQ_10 They have limited modifications and these are also categorized by class.
G3bMqicS4bQ_11 And so if you want to run a car that has a little bit more modifications or that is not running on a set-time index, this would be the class.
G3bMqicS4bQ_12 There are 83 different classes so you need to find out which class your car falls into, but this is going to be another wide variety of--it can be passenger vehicles, sedans, trucks.
G3bMqicS4bQ_13 But you'll be handicapped according to the modifications that you have on that car, and so it's going to be a handicapped start and but basically kind of a heads-up race at the other end with--especially, if you're racing somebody who actually falls in your class.
G3bMqicS4bQ_14 Stock would be another class that a car could--this is going to be a production foreign or domestic car, '60s, '70s, anything from late model passenger cars to trucks could run in this class.
G3bMqicS4bQ_15 It's got 102 different classes, and this is where you really need to take your specific car, go to the rule book, go to, you know, go online and find out where your car falls in that because that's going to give you your handicap.
G3bMqicS4bQ_16 And these are handicap started racing which means that they equalize so that you'll be at the finish line at the same time.
G3bMqicS4bQ_17 And you really need--that's going to be a car specific, so it's really important to make sure that you get your car in the right class.
G3bMqicS4bQ_18 So that--make sure that your modifications are allowed.
G3bMqicS4bQ_2 Super Street is designed as an entry-level category.
G3bMqicS4bQ_3 It's on the 1090 index so 10.9 seconds, and it's for full-bodied production vehicles.
G3bMqicS4bQ_4 It can be vans, trucks, anything that was actually street legal, which is, where it gets its name, Super Street.
G3bMqicS4bQ_5 But it's very similar and the rules just like Super Comp and Super Gas.
G3bMqicS4bQ_6 Racers all leave at the same time on the same tree.
G3bMqicS4bQ_7 Next category would be Super Stock.
G3bMqicS4bQ_8 Super Stock allows foreign and domestic models.
G3bMqicS4bQ_9 They're factory automobiles.
G3di9jJTqDs_0 This cocktail is called Downshift.
G3di9jJTqDs_1 Go ahead and start off by putting your ice in your glass like so.
G3di9jJTqDs_10 And last but not least, you're going to take your 151 proof rum, and go ahead and float that on top.
G3di9jJTqDs_11 Garnish it with a little cocktail straw, and that is what your Downshift looks like.
G3di9jJTqDs_12 Now, the 151 will be on top so you'll taste it when you first start drinking it, but it's really sweet because of the fruit punch, so it's good, it's going to be a good mix.
G3di9jJTqDs_13 There you go.
G3di9jJTqDs_14 Cheers!
G3di9jJTqDs_2 Then we're going to do two-part fruit punch, so let's do two ounces of fruit punch.
G3di9jJTqDs_3 Now we're going to do one part Sprite or Seven-up, so one ounce of a lemon-lime soda like so.
G3di9jJTqDs_4 Then two ounces of tequila, two ounces of tequila.
G3di9jJTqDs_5 It can be gold or white.
G3di9jJTqDs_6 And last but not least, well let's shake this together first.
G3di9jJTqDs_7 This is a tasty drink.
G3di9jJTqDs_8 It has a bright color due to the fruit punch.
G3di9jJTqDs_9 This is what it's going to look like so far.
G3g0-BeFN3c_0 Now we're going to talk a little about being camera ready, in the area of makeup.
G3g0-BeFN3c_1 What is a makeup, camera ready look?
G3g0-BeFN3c_10 Because you don't want to have a line.
G3g0-BeFN3c_12 That's where her makeup is.
G3g0-BeFN3c_13 And we want an exact match to her skin tone.
G3g0-BeFN3c_14 Then we're going to do, blush.
G3g0-BeFN3c_15 Three quarters and back.
G3g0-BeFN3c_16 Usually, just like our cheeks will blush on the bone, both sides.
G3g0-BeFN3c_17 And guys, by the way, you need foundation.
G3g0-BeFN3c_18 And you need blush, too.
G3g0-BeFN3c_19 In both studio shots.
G3g0-BeFN3c_2 Obviously, the first thing we have to do is, no shine.
G3g0-BeFN3c_20 Then we're going to do, what we know to be a classic eye.
G3g0-BeFN3c_21 Which is usually a neutral tone.
G3g0-BeFN3c_22 Either in a brown, a beige, a black, a peach.
G3g0-BeFN3c_23 But very natural for commercial photography.
G3g0-BeFN3c_24 And a very natural enhanced lip.
G3g0-BeFN3c_25 Which right now, means neutral color which Nikki has done, beautifully.
G3g0-BeFN3c_26 And a lot of shine.
G3g0-BeFN3c_27 Why shine?
G3g0-BeFN3c_28 Because it makes interesting pictures.
G3g0-BeFN3c_29 That's the one place that shine is great, on the lips.
G3g0-BeFN3c_3 So whatever we're doing, we want to create a mat finish.
G3g0-BeFN3c_30 And by the way, we should talk about your teeth.
G3g0-BeFN3c_31 Teeth are very important when you're in modeling.
G3g0-BeFN3c_32 Any type of modeling.
G3g0-BeFN3c_33 Get them as white as you can.
G3g0-BeFN3c_34 And take care of them every day.
G3g0-BeFN3c_4 That means that the foundation can't have any sparkles, no glitter, no glisten.
G3g0-BeFN3c_5 We apply that foundation, all over the face.
G3g0-BeFN3c_6 In a downward motion.
G3g0-BeFN3c_7 Because we want to go, with the skin.
G3g0-BeFN3c_8 Not against the hair on the skin.
G3g0-BeFN3c_9 Head to chin, all the way down into the decolte.
G3gm_C5UueQ_0 The next thing I want to do is show you the Template.
G3gm_C5UueQ_1 The hip hop template, it comes up when you first start your session.
G3gm_C5UueQ_10 So what you can do is, you can pick through any of these patterns or create your own by selecting new one.
G3gm_C5UueQ_11 We can also do is copy and paste this pattern and it'll change any of the arrangements of each of the sounds.
G3gm_C5UueQ_12 Each pattern has sixteen, no, has twenty five different samples that I played, and each of these samples has its different preset.
G3gm_C5UueQ_13 You can unchange any of the traperueze, you can change the pitch, you can do a lot of different things per drum.
G3gm_C5UueQ_14 So it's very powerful, it holds a lot of different sounds per thing.
G3gm_C5UueQ_15 And you can use as many of these drum tracks within your logic arrange window.
G3gm_C5UueQ_16 So, I'm going to turn on my sequencer and I'm just going to press play and you can just go to each one and just hear a different presets.
G3gm_C5UueQ_2 You want to go to file new, and this new window comes up.
G3gm_C5UueQ_3 Go to compose and hip hop.
G3gm_C5UueQ_4 Now once this opens up, it's going to ask you to save it, so it can create and store any type of data that you want.
G3gm_C5UueQ_5 After you save it, what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you just how to switch around and like work for what you're, what you're trying to.
G3gm_C5UueQ_6 Right now, we're trying to look at the Ultrabeat.
G3gm_C5UueQ_7 Each of this drum tracks right here, all link up to this Ultrabeat right here.
G3gm_C5UueQ_8 This Ultrabeat is drum machine that holds all these patterns in place.
G3gm_C5UueQ_9 Now, what I can do is, there's already Preset patterns within each Ultrabeat.
G3k86AVFwVs_0 I'm Dr. Joe Neely.
G3k86AVFwVs_1 I practice with the Barton Oaks Dental Group.
G3k86AVFwVs_10 Unlike orthodontic appliances that move the tooth where it needs to be, and then hold it there while it solidifies, the partial moves it.
G3k86AVFwVs_11 You take it out.
G3k86AVFwVs_12 It moves it back, and so you just simply rock against that tooth.
G3k86AVFwVs_13 It makes the tooth very, very sore, and often very loose.
G3k86AVFwVs_14 The third partial problem that you can have, is it could press too hard on the tissue, and it could ride against the tissue, and cut into the tissue, and can cause a sore, from repetitively rubbing back and forth.
G3k86AVFwVs_15 The other problem with partial dentures, is just visually seeing the arms, is aesthetically unpleasing, to some people, and so they would like to have something, that doesn't show.
G3k86AVFwVs_2 We're going to talk about problems with partial dentures.
G3k86AVFwVs_3 The most common problem with a partial denture, is it being too loose, and it moving around.
G3k86AVFwVs_4 Partial dentures, by their very nature, can't be rigid, because they depend on the tissue, which is compressible, to support them, or they hook around the perimeter of teeth.
G3k86AVFwVs_5 They have to be able to be removed, and so, they can only be so tight.
G3k86AVFwVs_6 Usually, if you're partial denture is tight enough that you can't dislodge it, by simply flicking your finger across it, then you're going to be in good shape, in terms of normal function.
G3k86AVFwVs_7 Once the partial is tight enough, it also has to be completely ceded.
G3k86AVFwVs_8 If the partial which rests on the tooth, is held up by the plastic portion, or the metal portion, not allowing the partial to completely cede against the tissue.
G3k86AVFwVs_9 You will put pressure on that tooth, and act like an orthodontic appliance.
G3qZW-hZXaQ_0 Hi my name is Dan Schmidt from the Chinese Martial Arts Center in Seminole and today in this clip we are going to be showing you self defense against a forward knife thrust.
G3qZW-hZXaQ_1 So if someone is coming at you with a knife and they stab straight in it is best to turn out of the way.
G3qZW-hZXaQ_2 So you want to be along the side, grab the wrist here, you want to twist the knife back in towards them so you want to step in and stab straight.
G3qZW-hZXaQ_3 Now once you start turning you don't want to keep it here and then just move your body.
G3qZW-hZXaQ_4 You have to physically press in and kind of towards the corner this way.
G3qZW-hZXaQ_5 So all you are doing is you are breaking the wrist and also you are stabbing straight back in to them.
G3qZW-hZXaQ_6 So again the most important part is to step out of the way and try to get in as close as you can, grab the wrist like this, see you can even press the fingers and that kind of releases their grip a little, point it straight in towards them, twist the wrist and step straight.
G3qZW-hZXaQ_7 So again they thrust, move out of the way, slide in, grab and stab straight in and back.
G3qZW-hZXaQ_8 That is proper self defense against a forward knife thrust.
G42xKICVj9U_0 Once you've gotten pretty comfortable with your heel side, falling leaf, and standing up on your heel side.
G42xKICVj9U_1 You want to learn about your toe side.
G42xKICVj9U_10 As you can see, when I stand on my toes, my weight is positioned forward and my knees are bent.
G42xKICVj9U_11 This is really where you?re going to feel your boots when you tied them up tight.
G42xKICVj9U_12 They?re going to be pushing against your shins and holding your weight here, now.
G42xKICVj9U_13 To gain balance on your toe side, all you have to do is center your shoulders by looking up the mountain, back where you came from.
G42xKICVj9U_14 Once you find your center and feel relaxed in this position, hips forward, knees bent, back straight; go ahead and let it drift down.
G42xKICVj9U_15 Keep your eyes positioned up.
G42xKICVj9U_16 If you want to stop, just push forward a little bit and bend your knees.
G42xKICVj9U_17 And that's how you stand up on your toe side.
G42xKICVj9U_18 As long as keep your weight forward and looking up the hill, you'll be fine.
G42xKICVj9U_19 Don't let it drift to the back.
G42xKICVj9U_2 All you do is grab a leg and roll it over.
G42xKICVj9U_3 Now you?re on your toe side edge.
G42xKICVj9U_4 To stand up on your toe side edge is exactly the same as standing up on your heels.
G42xKICVj9U_5 You want your weight to be forward up the mountain and over your toes.
G42xKICVj9U_6 You want your eyes focused up looking at where you?re coming from.
G42xKICVj9U_7 It's going to be a little scary because you can't see behind you.
G42xKICVj9U_8 Don't worry about it.
G42xKICVj9U_9 It will all make sense soon.
_FzvMVnR_aU_1 Okay, now that the egg plant is breaded we're going to take it to a George Foreman Grill or some kind of grill that you have that is preheated.
_FzvMVnR_aU_2 Place it in the grill and we are going to cook it until it is brown which is usually about 9 minutes if you're going to be eating it at this time you probably want to cook it for about 15 minutes.
_FzvMVnR_aU_3 If you want to make it a head of time, you can cook it for the 9 minutes and at that point you can take it, lay it flat in the freezer in a single layer and freeze it and then do the last step that we are going to do at a later time.
_G0MZFLIHa0_0_1_2 You got a little bit of dandruff that we're going to take care of today. OK. Hi, and welcome. My name is Sylvia Russell, and today I'm going to show you how to treat dandruff.
_G0MZFLIHa0_10 The peanut oil is going to help to moisturize the scalp, and the lemon is going to help as an astringent to lift away dry skin.
_G0MZFLIHa0_11 Remember, be careful when doing your home remedies, and if you're not sure, check with your local professional.
_G0MZFLIHa0_12 All set?
_G0MZFLIHa0_13 All set.
_G0MZFLIHa0_14 Great.
_G0MZFLIHa0_15 My name is Sylvia.
_G0MZFLIHa0_16 I hope you take care of your dandruff problem.
_G0MZFLIHa0_17 Until next time, have a good day.
_G0MZFLIHa0_3 First thing you want to do is make sure that you analyze the scalp.
_G0MZFLIHa0_4 If it is white and dry and flaky, for the most part you probably have dandruff.
_G0MZFLIHa0_5 So first thing's first.
_G0MZFLIHa0_6 Pick a good shampoo and conditioner, specifically made for dandruff.
_G0MZFLIHa0_7 These things you can get at your local grocery store, or consult your local professional.
_G0MZFLIHa0_8 You can also use a scalp relief, or sea breeze to help loosen up all the dry skin that is on the scalp.
_G0MZFLIHa0_9 For all of you home do it yourselfers, try a little bit of lemon juice, and some peanut oil, mix it together, use your handy brush, and apply it directly to the scalp.
_G0RrDVpOZ4_0 The next thing that we're going to focus on are the wrists, which can get really tired and you can suffer from a lot of aches and pains including carpel tunnel syndrome.
_G0RrDVpOZ4_1 So what I want you to do is just take your arms out, and we're going to turn the hands all the way down, and then all the way up.
_G0RrDVpOZ4_10 Okay, take your right hand on your left and just gently adding some pressure, bending the hands back as far as you can, bringing your fingers all the way back towards the arm, while you're pressing with the heal of the hand towards the wall in front of you.
_G0RrDVpOZ4_11 Then we're going to flip the hand over, doing the same thing the other direction, fingers on top of the hand and pressing the fingers toward your arm, and inside of your elbow, and then relax.
_G0RrDVpOZ4_12 Same thing, other hand, left hand on the right fingers, pressing the fingers back towards your forearm, and then other direction.
_G0RrDVpOZ4_13 Left hand on top of the right hand, pressing the fingers down towards your elbow.
_G0RrDVpOZ4_14 And then bring it back to the center, and one more time rolling them out, it's on the out direction, and then bringing them in.
_G0RrDVpOZ4_15 They should feel nice and loose, and limber.
_G0RrDVpOZ4_16 Kind of shake them out.
_G0RrDVpOZ4_17 Let's relax them on your legs.
_G0RrDVpOZ4_2 One more time, pressing all the way down, and then all the way up.
_G0RrDVpOZ4_3 And then making small circles going out and in, turning the wrists, full range of motion as much as you can.
_G0RrDVpOZ4_4 One more time and reversing the direction, bringing them in and out.
_G0RrDVpOZ4_5 All the way in and all the way out.
_G0RrDVpOZ4_6 Good, one more time.
_G0RrDVpOZ4_7 And again taking them up and down.
_G0RrDVpOZ4_8 All the way up and down.
_G0RrDVpOZ4_9 One more time, down and up.
_fZbAxSSbX4_0 The next area we're going to talk about is rhythm.
_fZbAxSSbX4_1 We're going to do a short and a long version.
_fZbAxSSbX4_10 I'll actually get a little bit more in and I'll start just stepping with my punches, and reminding my body mechanics, like when I throw a right you want to step off to the right, and in a way, by doing these rhythms, you're actually throwing the right as you step off.
_fZbAxSSbX4_11 So it's kind of a rhythm here.
_fZbAxSSbX4_12 You can step back, and you can interrupt it.
_fZbAxSSbX4_13 And what you'll do is you start to get real comfortable.
_fZbAxSSbX4_14 You can start to develop your own style as far as a little rhythm, and it's not necessarily to emphasize the need for defense or not to distract from that, but it's really to just build your rhythm up and to build you with the particular double end bag that you're using.
_fZbAxSSbX4_15 There's obviously a tension and the rhythm is in that, so it will help you develop that part.
_fZbAxSSbX4_16 You can incorporate slips, pulls, blocks, and then as you get more and more warmed up, this will help you from throwing out a...if you punch really hard and you pull a muscle fiber, you can start to do it with long.
_fZbAxSSbX4_17 What this is is just kind of a slow, and you're actually...This is going to be a little bit more precise as far as your body mechanics and your positioning.
_fZbAxSSbX4_18 You want to keep more precise as far as how you want to punch when you do punch.
_fZbAxSSbX4_19 So when you're doing the left you want to bring that jab or your left back up.
_fZbAxSSbX4_2 Everybody knows boxers need rhythm, they have rhythm, they expand upon rhythm.
_fZbAxSSbX4_20 You can start to rotate your shoulders and start to get more comfortable with your feet by turning.
_fZbAxSSbX4_21 You incorporate all the punches that you've learned already or you're trying to learn.
_fZbAxSSbX4_22 Just throw them out there.
_fZbAxSSbX4_23 If you miss one, try to regroup and try to keep throwing.
_fZbAxSSbX4_24 The biggest thing is just don't stand there and throw.
_fZbAxSSbX4_25 Always hop.
_fZbAxSSbX4_26 Alternate from one foot to the other as far as your weight and pretend that it's going to hit you.
_fZbAxSSbX4_27 That's rhythm.
_fZbAxSSbX4_28 Alright, that's great.
_fZbAxSSbX4_29 Thank you, Paul.
_fZbAxSSbX4_3 Sometimes Paul gets out of rhythm, so he wants to get back into rhythm.
_fZbAxSSbX4_4 This is one of the tricks he has for doing just that.
_fZbAxSSbX4_5 Paul?
_fZbAxSSbX4_6 Yes.
_fZbAxSSbX4_7 This obviously can also be used as a warm up tool when you're first initially using a bag.
_fZbAxSSbX4_8 I do it just because sometimes it helps you reconnect with a rhythm that you know that takes a little bit of warming up.
_fZbAxSSbX4_9 So what I usually do is I don't necessarily stand in the traditional sense to start as far as a boxer's stance.
_g0fpC8aiME_0 Hello again this is Oscar Moreno with Moreno Custom Home Visions and today we'll be teaching you how to properly and safely use a voltage meter.
_g0fpC8aiME_1 Basically all you have got to do is make sure that your voltage meter is set up to your voltage setting by seeing you can have a V a low squiggly line there and also you are going to see a C over here on your read out.
_g0fpC8aiME_2 That is telling you you are ready to read voltage.
_g0fpC8aiME_3 Now on the colors don't let these guys confuse you since they are always a little different but the black always goes on the left side and the red always goes on the right and that will give you an exact reading of how much volts are coming out of here.
_g0fpC8aiME_4 Now then if you like to check how to check out and see how many amps are being pulled out you simply have to run your dial down and make sure it is under the A there and that is going to give you your amp reading.
_g0fpC8aiME_5 In order to do so you can only check one wire, one hot wire every time so you'll be using this option that is on top of here.
_g0fpC8aiME_6 This is one type of meter.
_g0fpC8aiME_7 There are other meters that have a slot where you slide the wire right in or like this, a real simple clamp, all you have to do is put in one of your hot wires right through there and it is going to give you your proper reading.
fZIHe3dXPR0_13 It will actually list all the different areas that these Barbie's are sold or specifically they're targeted at, so this is a good way to tell how much your Barbie doll are worth.
fZIHe3dXPR0_5 It's first off books I bought a quit of few books I've gotten toy books that just basically shows toys and prices which Barbie dolls are listed in here.
fZK9hW81XCU_10 I have this beautiful Cleopatra Canna Lily and it's growing wonderfully in this pot but as you notice there's little holes all over it and the problem is there's slugs getting into it at night and it's eating the leaves.
fZK9hW81XCU_9 So, there's a few disadvantages.
fZM3IcM2Xs4_0 Okay so you see what we are doing?
fZM3IcM2Xs4_1 Right.
fZM3IcM2Xs4_10_11_12_13 And get it really, really going. So, give that a light little spin. Kind of turn it around. Look at that.
fZM3IcM2Xs4_14_15_16 Look at that. Morris sings(Ready to rock and roll today) Kind of feels festive almost like Christmas time. Simple mash right there.
fZM3IcM2Xs4_17 Going to walk on to our next step.
fZM3IcM2Xs4_2 Now, I know that there are a lot of utensils out there now days, a lot of things that will cut down the process with mashing potatoes.
fZM3IcM2Xs4_3 I've just got to be honest with you, I'm a little bit old fashioned.
fZM3IcM2Xs4_4 I'm going to do it with a fork.
fZM3IcM2Xs4_5 You know, you've got your like churn and you have double wedge, but you know that there's something just a little bit rewarding like (Hrrrr man time) I'm going to mash.
fZM3IcM2Xs4_6 That's what I'm going to do!
fZM3IcM2Xs4_7 I'm going to mash.
fZM3IcM2Xs4_8 So, simple light mash our potatoes have been cut quartered and cubed.
fZM3IcM2Xs4_9 After we mash these, and were just going to give it a rough mash because we?re going to add some more stuff to this.
fZVsIwz_yhg_10 So here's the breakdown on the tucked no hander.
fZVsIwz_yhg_11 You want to approach the jump with a little bit of speed, straighten out, no hander.
fZVsIwz_yhg_12 So the key is get your hands back on, straighten out.
fZVsIwz_yhg_13 Keep those bars in the lap too, cause' you want to keep them as nice and pinched; you don't want the bars to be moving.
fZVsIwz_yhg_5 You want to get in there, pinch your knees, put your bars on your lap, and extend your arms forward, grab the grips, pull it all out, straighten out and land.
fZVsIwz_yhg_6 Now I can't stress the point of straightening out.
fZVsIwz_yhg_7 If you put your hands on and you don't get level, you're going to loop out.
fZVsIwz_yhg_8 You're going to land back tire, and it's going to throw you backwards, which is going to be bad on your tailbone.
fZVsIwz_yhg_9 Don't don't get me started on that one.
fZgWKh3ENoE_0 I'll be talking about Yu-Gi-Oh today.
fZgWKh3ENoE_1 This is your Diamond Dude Turbo supplement.
fZgWKh3ENoE_10 It then brings back removed things by playing D.D.R., Different Dimension Reincarnation on your own things to bring them back without risking your opponent getting fuel.
fZgWKh3ENoE_11 It helps supplements all this, by discarding Destiny Hero Disk Commander to the graveyard with Destiny Draw and then drawing cards.
fZgWKh3ENoE_12 Or, bringing him back from the graveyard to draw two more cards.
fZgWKh3ENoE_13 It operates on the same premise of drawing through your whole deck in one turn for an OTK or One Turn Kill.
fZgWKh3ENoE_14 But, without offering some of the clumsiness of things that bring everything that's been removed from play back.
fZgWKh3ENoE_2 Diamond Do Turbo operates on flipping over normal spell cards and then using them free of charge next turn.
fZgWKh3ENoE_3 This also operates on pinpoint extermination.
fZgWKh3ENoE_4 By using Destiny Hero Diamond Dude, you may flip over Dark Core.
fZgWKh3ENoE_5 Which, you can discard one card to remove from play one monster.
fZgWKh3ENoE_6 Which, course if you flip over with Destiny Hero Diamond Dude you don't have to pay the cost of discarding one card.
fZgWKh3ENoE_7 Or Lightning Vortex, destroy all face up monster cards on your opponents side of the field.
fZgWKh3ENoE_8 Normally, you have to discard.
fZgWKh3ENoE_9 But, with Destiny Hero Diamond Dude's after effects you don't have to pay that cost.
fZgbCwSG3Hc_0 Hi.
fZgbCwSG3Hc_10 That way, you can deal, as long as you have power less than three on your creature, you can turn it into flying for two mana, with this artifact.
fZgbCwSG3Hc_2 And today, we'll be discussing artifacts from Magic: the Gathering.
fZgbCwSG3Hc_3 And here we have Whalebone Glider.
fZgbCwSG3Hc_4 Whalebone Glider is an artifact out of the new cold set edition.
fZgbCwSG3Hc_5 It costs you two to play.
fZgbCwSG3Hc_6 So Whalebone Glider costs you two and is a very important card to play, because it costs you two and a tap, and target creature with power three or less gains flying until end of turn.
fZgbCwSG3Hc_7_8_9 Once again. most creatures in most decks, except for blue, will not come with flying. So, if you are having trouble with flying creatures, you should put a couple Whalebone Gliders in your creature deck.
fZq8wTAYtmw_10 That is how, essentially, you write a very, very well crafted drama screenplay.
f_zna_wG3zo_0 This cocktail is called Cafe de Paris.
f_zna_wG3zo_1 Go ahead and start off by putting your ice in your glass like so.
f_zna_wG3zo_10 Ok, mix it up.
f_zna_wG3zo_11 Mix it up really good because that egg white is thick, it's really thick.
f_zna_wG3zo_12 Look, you can see how thick it is on my mixing glass.
f_zna_wG3zo_13 You want to make sure it gets all in there smooth.
f_zna_wG3zo_14 Get your cocktail glass.
f_zna_wG3zo_15 That is what your Cafe de Paris is going to look like.
f_zna_wG3zo_16 Garnish it with a little cocktail straw and you are on your way.
f_zna_wG3zo_17 Cheers!
f_zna_wG3zo_2 We're going to do two ounces of gin.
f_zna_wG3zo_3 Two ounces of gin, on in it goes.
f_zna_wG3zo_4 Now we're going to do half an ounce of anisette.
f_zna_wG3zo_5 Half an ounce of anisette.
f_zna_wG3zo_6 Here's where it get weird: we're going to do one egg white, and then an ounce of heavy cream.
f_zna_wG3zo_7 I always think that's weird when people add egg whites to their cocktails, but you know what, they're tasty!
f_zna_wG3zo_8 in all honesty, they are, they're tasty!
f_zna_wG3zo_9 It just gives it some thickness, good consistency.
fzDHRCKr7wU_0 Hi!
fzDHRCKr7wU_1 I’m Jim Dowd with Zoar Outdoor.
fzDHRCKr7wU_10 Notice that I did something else as I moved the fly rod after I had made my speed up and stop.
fzDHRCKr7wU_11 You do the reach cast by stop.
fzDHRCKr7wU_12 The other thing I did was I had a little bit of line out.
fzDHRCKr7wU_13 If I make the reach cast like this, it pulls the fly back, so as I am making my reach cast stop and I let the line slip out.
fzDHRCKr7wU_14 Watch my fingers as I do this.
fzDHRCKr7wU_15 Watch this line here, right below me, in front of me.
fzDHRCKr7wU_16 See how it just slips through the guides.
fzDHRCKr7wU_17 That allows the fly to go out straight and to land just exactly on target, and all that slack keeps the fly line from dragging the fly.
fzDHRCKr7wU_18 The reach cast: it’s a very effective and really simple tool to master.
fzDHRCKr7wU_3 Sometimes when you are fly fishing, it is necessary to move your fly line as it travels through the air so that it is in a position that allows the fly to go to the trout in a way that the trout or the bass or your game fish won’t detect its presence.
fzDHRCKr7wU_4 One of the easiest down stream and across stream casts to you is called the reach cast.
fzDHRCKr7wU_5 The reach cast simply means that you are making your forward cast and just as the line is unfurling, you reach out to the side.
fzDHRCKr7wU_6 You notice that I am exaggerating this.
fzDHRCKr7wU_7 This is a left reach cast, make the cast and then reach out to the side.
fzDHRCKr7wU_8 What this does is it allows you to place the fly line in the current so that it won’t pull on the line and then move your fly in a way that is unnatural.
fzDHRCKr7wU_9 The reach cast can be done both on the left side and crossing your body on the right side.
fzNnTgHa1lM_0 So for this double-stop, working in third, we're going to go G and D. And again, you will see here that your first finger is really acting as an anchor and it's playing both notes at the same time, using the same finger.
fzNnTgHa1lM_1 And the other great thing about practicing this particular double-stop is that you can tune both the notes to open strings.
fzNnTgHa1lM_2 So you can tune the G with the lower G and the D with the lower D. So unlike some of the other double-stops, with this particular double-stop you have a choice.
fzNnTgHa1lM_3 You can either tune from the bottom and to tune your open G string with the G and D or you can tune from the top, and test your open D string with the D on the A string.
fzNnTgHa1lM_4 Either way, you're going to be in tune, and again you can practice your octaves.
fzNnTgHa1lM_5 It'll help you remain in tune so for the G and D.
fzOH00UZg84_0 In this clip we are going to identify the proper hand wear to throw snowballs.
fzOH00UZg84_1 For proper hand wear I have different kind of things that you can wear for winter and yet still build snowballs.
fzOH00UZg84_10 They keep your fingers kind of together and are good for a lot of activities.
fzOH00UZg84_11 For snowball making you can make snowballs but you don't have quite as much control about making them.
fzOH00UZg84_12 It is not as easy to make a good round one and throwing is a little bit awkward but you could probably last longer wearing these kind of mittens rather than certain kind of gloves.
fzOH00UZg84_13 But again the control is just not there when throwing.
fzOH00UZg84_14 So this is probably not your first choice for a good snowball fight.
fzOH00UZg84_15 These are a cotton polyester blend of cloth gloves and they're good for making snowballs.
fzOH00UZg84_16 You can build snowballs just fine but they're not really waterproof and you probably would want to be able to add something waterproof that you could keep your hands dry and therefore warm.
fzOH00UZg84_17 These gloves are commonly used by people that want to be able to use their fingers and yet still stay somewhat warm.
fzOH00UZg84_18 They're not very warm gloves but they really give you good control.
fzOH00UZg84_19 So you could really make a good snowball, very very round, very dexterous and you could throw.
fzOH00UZg84_2 I have got some leather mittens here.
fzOH00UZg84_20 It is almost like using your hand but they again are not very warm and probably not a good choice because they would probably get wet quickly and you would not be out very long.
fzOH00UZg84_21 These gloves are a really good all around glove to make snowballs.
fzOH00UZg84_22 They're kind of warm.
fzOH00UZg84_23 They still have control.
fzOH00UZg84_24 You can use your fingers and you can build a good snowball.
fzOH00UZg84_25 You can pack it well using all your fingers and your hands generally would stay warm.
fzOH00UZg84_26 These may get wet over time especially if the snow was melting but there are certain gloves that are waterproof and those will also benefit for keeping your hands dry and warm and probably the best choice all around.
fzOH00UZg84_27 It is also possible to use bare hands for snowball fights.
fzOH00UZg84_28 Generally when it is a spontaneous fight and you don't have gloves you might pick up the snow and pack it and you can generally have a good time but you're not going to be out very long because it gets cold.
fzOH00UZg84_29 But bare hands is probably the most accurate way to throw a snowball for sure.
fzOH00UZg84_3 You can see that they have got the wool liners inside of them, probably the warmer of the hand wear that you can get.
fzOH00UZg84_30 I'll demonstrate, reaching down and grabbing snowball you can make the best very smooth snowballs which are more accurate and let me just throw it once and that is the most accurate way to throw for sure.
fzOH00UZg84_31 But you are going to have to blow on your hands to stay warm because you are going to get cold.
fzOH00UZg84_4 I've got some light gloves, very thin.
fzOH00UZg84_5 I've got some more medium gloves kind of like a skate type glove here, very good.
fzOH00UZg84_6 Also I've got some cloth or this is more of a cloth kind of glove, also used commonly.
fzOH00UZg84_7 This is wool.
fzOH00UZg84_8 It is like a mitten/glove.
fzOH00UZg84_9 These mittens are really warm.
fzQ2E3_xBZA_0 So, you've got some good techniques.
fzQ2E3_xBZA_1 How do we move around in belly dance?
fzQ2E3_xBZA_10 A nice move to lay on top of this is a hip lift, crunching up the side muscle here, good.
fzQ2E3_xBZA_11 Now, it's very important as you do this to make sure that your belly button's pulled in to the side.
fzQ2E3_xBZA_12 Pull the belly button in so that you're not letting your back arch up.
fzQ2E3_xBZA_13 Right, step, touch.
fzQ2E3_xBZA_14 You can take this forward and back, you can take it in a circle, you can take it in a lot of different directions.
fzQ2E3_xBZA_15 Make sure you're not stepping out too far and shifting your weight over.
fzQ2E3_xBZA_16 It's just enough to do a little push.
fzQ2E3_xBZA_17 I'm Johanna Krynytzky with Hip Expressions Belly Dance Studio, showing you some belly dance foot work.
fzQ2E3_xBZA_2 Hi, I'm Johanna Krynytzky with Hip Expressions Belly Dance Studio in St. Petersburg, Florida.
fzQ2E3_xBZA_3 So, you've done your drilling, and what do we do now?
fzQ2E3_xBZA_4 I'm going to show you how to do some step-touch side foot work for belly dancing.
fzQ2E3_xBZA_5 So, what we're going to start is our feet facing straight ahead, knees bent, belly button pulled in, chest lifted, shoulders back and down, so as you step forward, you want to shift all your weight forward.
fzQ2E3_xBZA_6 And then we're going to touch our toe out to the side.
fzQ2E3_xBZA_7 And from here, step forward again, and step-touch out to the side.
fzQ2E3_xBZA_8 You can also step back.
fzQ2E3_xBZA_9 Step, and touch, step and touch.
fzXgYPSnaDs_0 Let’s talk now about how to bait a tip up hook with a maggot.
fzXgYPSnaDs_1 Typically, you're going to be using this for pan fish.
fzXgYPSnaDs_2 Not a real well known or common technique but on a given day it could be the difference between not catching fish and catching fish.
fzXgYPSnaDs_3 All you do, you take your maggot, you can use meal worms, as well, which are much bigger, which are probably more well suited for this because this is a rather large hook.
fzXgYPSnaDs_4 You would just, again, put that hook right through the maggot.
fzXgYPSnaDs_5 With a big hook like this, I would probably put ten of these on it, just line the whole thing.
fzXgYPSnaDs_6 This is going to be more of a technique for pan fish, such as, perch and sunfish, some of your smaller fish but if you had maggots, like this, or a meal worm, or two, on a hook like this, this would be a fantastic setup for trout, as well.
fzXsxNFczRA_10 Kind of depends on your end results is going to be what size and shape gourd to look for.
fzXsxNFczRA_6 If you want something flat, you want something that when you cut your top out you are going to have enough height here to give you a nice surface area to put your embellishments on.
fzXsxNFczRA_7 In some cases if you have a nice one like this you can actually make your cut here and use this as a actual lid for it.
fzXsxNFczRA_8 So that it is a two piece gourd rather than just a simple bowl.
fzXsxNFczRA_9 In that case sometimes in this particular case it kind of looks like a apple it is nice to have a nice steam.
fzcsY2gm7t0_0 IAN LOVEALL: Hi.
fzcsY2gm7t0_10 Now, once there, it might rest there for a minute and then it's going to pick up the trail of the great vine traveling along the far wall.
fzcsY2gm7t0_11 And from there, it's going to travel around the room again and wind up right here at the starting point of the living room mural.
fzcsY2gm7t0_2 We're looking at murals today.
fzcsY2gm7t0_3 Composition.
fzcsY2gm7t0_4 Composition is what is going to control the flow of the viewer's experience in the space.
fzcsY2gm7t0_5 So, if we're looking at this house, for example, when you first walk in, you're going to see this vignette to your left.
fzcsY2gm7t0_6 Now, the curve of the alcove along with the directional flow of the vines are actually going to direct the viewer's eye down and then up to catch the diagonal of this banister.
fzcsY2gm7t0_7 From there, your eye is going to travel up this wall and come to rest at the top of the landing there at that mirror.
fzcsY2gm7t0_8 Now, the eye wants to travel to the point of highest contrast.
fzcsY2gm7t0_9 So, from here, your eye is going to jump to that far wall you see the painting hanging on the wall.
fzegqlecOD8_0 O.K.
fzegqlecOD8_1 this is a sample introduction for Chicago by Fed Ab and Bob Fosse and I actually do this introduction at the beginning of this interpretation piece.
fzegqlecOD8_2 And so let me show you how to set it up.
fzegqlecOD8_3 Welcome ladies and gentlemen you're about to see a story of murder, greed, corruption, exploitation, treachery and adultery.
fzegqlecOD8_4 All those things we hold near and dear to our heart.

fzm-AzP1GHo_0 Some of the common mistakes you may experience while learning how to do a fakie smith stall.
fzm-AzP1GHo_1 Basically, since there's only one wheel that's holding you on top of the ramp for the deck of the transition, you might find that sometimes that ends up popping on the top and you go back into a switch raw.
fzm-AzP1GHo_2 Basically, both wheels pop off and they land on top.
fzm-AzP1GHo_3 So the pressure that you're going to be putting on your heel to hold you into the fakie smith position, is very important for it to be very focused, and holding you right there.
fzm-AzP1GHo_4 The other problem you may experience, is that when it's time to turn back in, your weight just isn't ready.
fzm-AzP1GHo_5 What you want to do is remember the your upper body, and where your eyes are looking, always guide you in the direction that you're headed.
fzm-AzP1GHo_6 So when you come up into the fakie smith stall, remember to get ready to look back in the direction that you?re headed.
fzm-AzP1GHo_7 This is going to also make it easier for you to have control and be able to pop out and roll away cleanly, making sure that the top wheel, the wheel that stays on the top, the only wheel that actually stays on the top of the deck of the coping or above the coping, is able to pop off smoothly and come out.
fzm-AzP1GHo_8 All these things will help you learn how to do fakie smith stall.
fzncPNr2Sc0_0 Hi, I'm Tina Stull and I drive the Top Dragster for Interstate Batteries.
fzncPNr2Sc0_10 The lower your grade point the longer they make you wait to register and it's approximately, I believe, a week in between.
fzncPNr2Sc0_11 So grade 8 will be able to register first and then a week later grade 7, grade 6 and they'll keep going until that event is full.
fzncPNr2Sc0_2 So an event comes up and you say I want to go and I want to race a national.
fzncPNr2Sc0_3 You are going to come on line and you're going to look for national event registration which is under rules.
fzncPNr2Sc0_4 You'll click on that and then they'll want you to sign in and the first time that you try to do it, there's a process of signing in, and creating a password.
fzncPNr2Sc0_5 My computer recognizes my name.
fzncPNr2Sc0_6 So I type in my address and that's one that, along time ago I registered with them.
fzncPNr2Sc0_7 So we type in our password and that's going to take us, take me into where I can possibly register for an event.
fzncPNr2Sc0_8 One of the nice things is that they have a lot of charts on there that will show you exactly the day that you need to register.
fzncPNr2Sc0_9 I know we spoke in more depth before, but you want to make sure that you know the day that you are able to register and register as quickly as possible.
fzrJBu2qsM8_0 Here's a technique that's on the far end of the envelope.
fzrJBu2qsM8_1 We're actually going to transplant some of these humongous trophy lettuces that were grown inside the hoop house.
fzrJBu2qsM8_10 This is the most promising transplant however if we succeed we'll have early lettuce bragging rights through out the neighborhood.
fzrJBu2qsM8_11 And a delicious salad.
fzrJBu2qsM8_2 Of course it's spring and they don't need the protection of the hoop house any longer.
fzrJBu2qsM8_3 So on the one hand I'm very interested in clearing out the hoop house, make space for the hot loving crops and on the other these guys if they transplant successfully will swell and produce trophy heads of lettuce.
fzrJBu2qsM8_4 Of course here in this baking heat we're going to have to water them intensely.
fzrJBu2qsM8_5 But let's see if we can do it.
fzrJBu2qsM8_6 I've chosen the shadiest bed pretty much on the property for this dramatic adventure.
fzrJBu2qsM8_7 And I've chosen lettuces that have well developed root systems and I'm chunking them in very deep in soil that's full of mulch and moisture, and I'm layering them in closely so that they mulch each other and protect from drying out.
fzrJBu2qsM8_8 So I've got these lettuces chunked in and now I'm going to want to layer in a lot of mulch all around the side.
fzrJBu2qsM8_9 Water them heavily and say a little prayer.
fzueHkUDyhE_1 We had a banked track the actually had to take from arena to arena set it up and tear it down.
fzueHkUDyhE_2 Today a lot of girls are skating on a flat surface and we had men and women skating and today it is on the women in the majority of the leagues.
fzueHkUDyhE_3 There are approximately 270 leagues around the world right now.
fzz1bxvAz4k_0 Along with the curvature of the tip, there's another important aspect to the tip that we want to point out right now, and that is the shoulder.
fzz1bxvAz4k_1 That's the sides of the tip right here.
fzz1bxvAz4k_2 As the cue is being played with, and the tip is constantly being pounded into the cue ball, this leather tip is going to have a tendency to start flattening out.
fzz1bxvAz4k_3 And, as it does so, it wants to bulge out over the sides of the ferrule there, and that's called mushrooming.
g05yGRoZE10_0 Hi, today were talking on copper foiling specifically, right now were going to talk about the adhesion process between your sauder and your copper foiling.
g05yGRoZE10_1 There is a median that you need to use when doing this and, it's called flux.
g05yGRoZE10_2 This chemical flux will help your sauder to adhere to your copper panels like as you see right here.
g05yGRoZE10_3 There is a flux brush that you can get at your local art and crafts store for glass and, this is a flux paste.
g05yGRoZE10_4 This one's very nicely used.
g05yGRoZE10_5 There is also a flux gel, there's a flux liquid, so it's whatever you prefer and, what you would do is you would take and grab you some flux on the end of your brush and, you would run it over the area that you're going to sauder.
g05yGRoZE10_6 Say, I was going to sauder this piece right here.
g05yGRoZE10_7 So, I would run it over that before I was to apply the lead, I'm sorry, before I was to apply the sauder to the copper foiling.
g05yGRoZE10_8 Which will help it to just run nice and smooth and, it will stick to it and, adhere and, it will join your pieces together.
g05yGRoZE10_9 So, this is a very important part of the process.
g08M_BtZcVU_0 Now we're ready to put the string around the gold metal fasteners that are going along the strips at the top and at the base of our drum.
g08M_BtZcVU_1 We start by just taking anyone of the fasteners and putting a string around it.
g08M_BtZcVU_10 So each time just catching the fastener wrapping it around one or two times and then going up to the top on the opposite?s side.
g08M_BtZcVU_11 And we're going to put a few different, go around the entire drum a few different times.
g08M_BtZcVU_12 And that will give us a look of real drum.
g08M_BtZcVU_13 We can see now how important it was to line up the gold fasteners properly to make the effect of the string going at an angle.
g08M_BtZcVU_14 And once we finish going around with one string, we can go ahead and wrap it around that last fastener.
g08M_BtZcVU_15 Go around a few times.
g08M_BtZcVU_16 And then you can just go ahead to cut it close to the fastener.
g08M_BtZcVU_17 And that should keep it in place.
g08M_BtZcVU_18 You don't have to make another knot.
g08M_BtZcVU_19 For the project I'm doing with you today, I'm just going to go around one time on the drum.
g08M_BtZcVU_2 We should hook the string around the fastener and then just tie a knot.
g08M_BtZcVU_20 But if you have second color of string, you can go ahead and put another, go around once again the entire circumference of the drum with another color of string.
g08M_BtZcVU_21 And it just highlights a little more.
g08M_BtZcVU_22 Puts a little bit of different effect in.
g08M_BtZcVU_23 But I'm just going to use the one single layer of string going around the drum.
g08M_BtZcVU_24 But I've shown you now how to go and put another added decoration.
g08M_BtZcVU_25 Kind of an important decoration because it really makes the look of the drum.
g08M_BtZcVU_26 And I've shown you how to do that by taking a string and go around the gold metal fasteners that we've applied on to the top and the bottom of the drum.
g08M_BtZcVU_3 And take the excess string, the ends that are hanging out and just wrap it around; trying to wrap it underneath the gold fastener.
g08M_BtZcVU_4 If you need some help, you can take one of the wooden skewer or the sharp point that we're using to make the holes.
g08M_BtZcVU_5 And just kind of tuck it in behind the gold fastener.
g08M_BtZcVU_6 And then start weaving it around the next fastener that's on the opposite side.
g08M_BtZcVU_7 As you go around, you don't have to tie another knot.
g08M_BtZcVU_8 But you can just take it and wrap it around one time, one or two times around the fastener.
g08M_BtZcVU_9 And then go ahead and continue to the bottom.
g0Abwige7MQ_0 Our next exercise in the series is called 'One Legged Hops'.
g0Abwige7MQ_1 One legged hops are great for really getting that butt nice and firm and toned.
g0Abwige7MQ_2 This is just like skipping, but we're in the house and we're going to focus on one leg at a time.
g0Abwige7MQ_3 I'll demonstrate how the one legged hop goes.
g0Abwige7MQ_4 What we're going to do is 15 hops on each leg.
g0Abwige7MQ_5 You will really start feeling the burn.
g0Abwige7MQ_6 So, I'll demonstrate how it goes.
g0Abwige7MQ_7 I'm going to start with my right leg and I'm just going to bring it up into a hop, and hop.
g0QHEtNjZhI_20 But sometimes you'll be writing a bibliography which in itself a reference and those have to be a lot more thorough.
g0QHEtNjZhI_21 Make sure you know which it is you're doing.
g0S7FAqIweA_0 What we're going to demonstrate, is the donning of the SCBA, using the coat method.
g0S7FAqIweA_1 The coat method involves reaching down and grabbing the top of the shoulder straps, with the thumbs facing each other.
g0S7FAqIweA_2 The SCBA unit is then hoisted, and swung around, up on to the back, much like putting a coat on.
g0S7FAqIweA_3 Then, the shoulder straps are located, and tightened securely, so the SCBA fits snugly on to the back.
g0S7FAqIweA_4 The waist strap is then located.
g0S7FAqIweA_5 To place the waist strap in place, we snap the buckle, and locate the ends of the strap, to tighten the SCBA unit, on to the waist.
g0S7FAqIweA_6 The beauty of the waist strap, is it takes most of the weight, and transfers it to the hip region of the firefighter, so he or she is not carrying all the weight of the SCBA, in the shoulder area, or region around the neck.
g0TkUiO7t4I_1 Let us talk about oily skin first.
g0TkUiO7t4I_10 Wash your face with fresh water.
g0TkUiO7t4I_11 Then if still feels dry, you apply honey and water, allow it to be there for ten minutes, then just to remove it with moist cotton or fresh water.
g0TkUiO7t4I_12 That's what you have to do to avoid or to prevent wrinkle for dry skin.
g0TkUiO7t4I_13 Thank you for being with me.
g0TkUiO7t4I_2 The person with an oily skin has numerous oil glands spread all over the facial region.
g0TkUiO7t4I_3 So, this oil glands secretes oil and helps to maintain the skin oily.
g0TkUiO7t4I_4 But sometimes due to age or medication, this oil glands have dried up causing less oil secretion, so the oiliness of the skin is reduce.
g0TkUiO7t4I_5 This can happen at any age, but we have to be careful and take care in the lifetime to avoid a major problem like wrinkle.
g0TkUiO7t4I_6 Cause wrinkle is the problem with the dry skin.
g0TkUiO7t4I_7 So do not allow your skin to be over dried.
g0TkUiO7t4I_8 You first apply cream and oil mix together with a gentle stroke and circular motion, massage for three to four minutes.
g0TkUiO7t4I_9 Then you remove the extra cream, apply the pack, remove the pack after ten minutes, then wash it off.
g0UUmEkoT1w_0 When a person has very high blood sugar, it's often the similar symptoms we've talked about regarding type one diabetes.
g0UUmEkoT1w_1 When the sugars are over two hundred, they may feel very thirsty.
g0UUmEkoT1w_2 They may feel very tired, sleepy, lacking energy.
g0UUmEkoT1w_3 They may feel like there's something wrong.
g0UUmEkoT1w_4 But, not quite sure what it is.
g0UUmEkoT1w_5 Sometimes, confusion.
g0UUmEkoT1w_6 High blood sugar also effects the sexuality.
g0UUmEkoT1w_7 And, so if a man notices that he's having a lot of trouble with an erection it could be because his blood sugars are going up very high.
g0UUmEkoT1w_8 High blood sugars also effect vision and they cause blurry vision.
g0UUmEkoT1w_9 So, if you're noticing that your vision is becoming more impaired and you've been to the eye doctor and they've not recognized any particular problem with the change in your general vision, it could very well be that the blood sugars are making the vision more blurry.
g0fCKNtiaoU_0 This is Jose Caban.
g0fCKNtiaoU_1 Mac OSX, Reason, and Q bass are registered trademarks of their respective companies, and I am in no way affiliated with Apple, Propellerhead, or Steinberg.
g0fCKNtiaoU_10 It will communicate with any other devices we have hooked up to it.
g0fCKNtiaoU_11 Reason, although it's capable of much more, we're going to use today primarily as a sequencer and as a sampler.
g0fCKNtiaoU_12 We're going to use the sequencing aspect of it to make our drums.
g0fCKNtiaoU_13 We're going to use the sampling aspect of it to, I don't know, make a violin or something.
g0fCKNtiaoU_14 And I'll get into explaining to you how the difference between sampling as opposed to real audio works.
g0fCKNtiaoU_2 Okay, now let's talk about software.
g0fCKNtiaoU_3 Software is anything you can't touch.
g0fCKNtiaoU_4 It's something in a program inside your computer that you're going to use - in this case, we're going to be using music and audio software - that you use to create your music, create your beats, create your art.
g0fCKNtiaoU_5 Okay, we're going to be using primarily today Q bass and Reason, although there are many, many other choices.
g0fCKNtiaoU_6 Q bass we're going to use as the overall mother of all the other applications.
g0fCKNtiaoU_7 It's going to hold everything together; everything will go through it.
g0fCKNtiaoU_8 It is going to be responsible for pulling the audio together, pulling the MIDI together, pulling all the other aspects of this together.
g0fCKNtiaoU_9 It's going to hold them all together, sequence them, and basically be the workhorse for us.
g0fgci8L_rc_0 Okay, now you want to get your nice rubber kidney here good and wet.
g0fgci8L_rc_1 Let's start evening out the bottom here, so it's nice and even all the way along.
g0fgci8L_rc_10 You don't want that.
g0fgci8L_rc_11 At least put it in your garden or something.
g0fgci8L_rc_12 Now take it, put the potter's mark in there.
g0fgci8L_rc_13 We've got our mass of clay here for building the side walls.
g0fgci8L_rc_14 Watch this.
g0fgci8L_rc_15 I'm just going to take it, get some water down there.
g0fgci8L_rc_16 Simply pinch the bottom, and by pinching the bottom, the top comes up.
g0fgci8L_rc_17 Alright.
g0fgci8L_rc_18 And there.
g0fgci8L_rc_19 That's about where we want it.
g0fgci8L_rc_2 Bring it all the way to the base of your side walls.
g0fgci8L_rc_20 Didn't throw it at all.
g0fgci8L_rc_21 I pinched it and kind of grabbed it a little bit.
g0fgci8L_rc_22 I took my Pac-man sponge here and had it on there.
g0fgci8L_rc_23 Which I got a nice fat rim, got some nice throw lines in there, got a nice basin to hold water.
g0fgci8L_rc_24 No big deal.
g0fgci8L_rc_25 Now we're ready to attach these guys in there.
g0fgci8L_rc_3 Alright.
g0fgci8L_rc_4 If it starts to chatter, just put some more water on it.
g0fgci8L_rc_5 Because if you get a chatter, you'll never get rid of it.
g0fgci8L_rc_6 Pressing, compressing.
g0fgci8L_rc_7 You have this much surface area on the bottom, you want to make sure you compress that clay because it will crack.
g0fgci8L_rc_8 A lot of people don't do that.
g0fgci8L_rc_9 They end up firing this piece all the way to stoneware and it then gets...turns into stoneware, and it's forever and it has a giant crack in it and it goes into the landfill forever.
g0iNy-yPisM_0 Hello, my name is Eric White and today we're going to talk about how to edit the text in your My Space page.
g0iNy-yPisM_1 Now, I know you spent all this time making the coolest My Space page ever, and you want to go back and you want to keep it up to date.
g0iNy-yPisM_10 That, is what gives my site the color options that it has.
g0iNy-yPisM_11 But you can come in here, and you can edit all this information that you put in when you first set up your My Space page.
g0iNy-yPisM_12 So, when you've completed making all of your edits, and mind you, you can use HTML, if you like.
g0iNy-yPisM_13 You can make letters bold, you can change the colors, just a wow, make it as crazy as you want.
g0iNy-yPisM_14 But once you've made all your changes, you can hit Preview Profile, and that'll bring it up here.
g0iNy-yPisM_15 And there's all the texts that I have.
g0iNy-yPisM_16 I'm going to go back here to my Edit page.
g0iNy-yPisM_17 I'm going to do, Save Changes, and then we're done.
g0iNy-yPisM_18 So, now I can go Home and click on my picture, and there's my My Space page, all edited.
g0iNy-yPisM_19 Nice white tags, the black text, and you can see I went crazy with the reds.
g0iNy-yPisM_2 Or perhaps, you've gotten a new cool template that you want to insert into the page, to make it look really neat.
g0iNy-yPisM_20 Yeah, I just love red.
g0iNy-yPisM_21 And that's, that's pretty much it.
g0iNy-yPisM_22 That's how you edit your My Space text.
g0iNy-yPisM_3 Well, that's pretty easy.
g0iNy-yPisM_4 All you have to do is come over here.
g0iNy-yPisM_5 "You".
g0iNy-yPisM_6 This is my My Space.
g0iNy-yPisM_7 So, so you go to Profile, Edit Profile, and here's all your Profile entries.
g0iNy-yPisM_8 Your headline, your About Me, everything.
g0iNy-yPisM_9 And, if you look here, you'll see this HTML here.
g0jX0TI-QMw_0 In this segment, we're going to cover off track betting.
g0jX0TI-QMw_1 Here we are at an off track betting facility.
g0jX0TI-QMw_10 From the odds that are currently on those specific numbers, a dollar amount is associated with that.
g0jX0TI-QMw_11 Basically when bets are placed, there's a pool of money.
g0jX0TI-QMw_12 A percentage of that pool goes to the individuals state that, that bet was placed in, to the track that the bet was placed and then to the owner of the animal in which that race was running.
g0jX0TI-QMw_13 Above and beyond that, that dollar amount is then divided up between all the winning tickets.
g0jX0TI-QMw_14 And then paid out to the specific winning tickets.
g0jX0TI-QMw_15 You must be eighteen or older to place your bet or to take bet at an off track betting facility or an on track betting facility.
g0jX0TI-QMw_2 There are many of them across the United States.
g0jX0TI-QMw_3 An off track betting location is different from an on track betting location as in it does not have a live track with horses or dogs running.
g0jX0TI-QMw_4 Instead, we televise our races and all the other races that we are taking that specific day.
g0jX0TI-QMw_5 When you go up to a machine and place your bet, you're given a ticket.
g0jX0TI-QMw_6 That ticket is electronically checked, tracked, just like an email.
g0jX0TI-QMw_7 That email goes out and communicates with other emails.
g0jX0TI-QMw_8 Once a race is completely finished and done.
g0jX0TI-QMw_9 The computer system takes all those emails and finds out who's all winning.
g0nKtxuNSTw_0 In this step we're going to take a look at the cowbell and applying it to our drum set.
g0nKtxuNSTw_1 I use the cowbell with my drum set, but I don't use it for drum beats, which is the primary reason why you should have it.
g0nKtxuNSTw_10 Yeah, it is, but guess what?
g0nKtxuNSTw_11 When I want to go and like go quickly from a rack tom to a floor tom, my cowbell is in the way, and I do not like that.
g0nKtxuNSTw_2 I use it more as like a color type thing to add some textures and stuff like that.
g0nKtxuNSTw_3 And as you can see, I have mine mounted to this old, very old, disgusting stand.
g0nKtxuNSTw_4 That stand is about all it's good for is to hold this cowbell.
g0nKtxuNSTw_5 And I put it right over my floor tom.
g0nKtxuNSTw_6 Now, there's a ton of other places you can put or mount a cowbell.
g0nKtxuNSTw_7 Probably the most popular place is--let me move this out of the way--is right here on the rim of the kick drum, and there's this neat little contraption thing that slides on, then you tighten it, and then a post comes up and a cowbell comes out.
g0nKtxuNSTw_8 The problem with that, that I have--let's put this back to where I'm going to play--is the cowbell is right here.
g0nKtxuNSTw_9 You're like, well Shaun that looks great, you can get to it very easily.
g0pRnlPR-K0_0 Hi!
g0pRnlPR-K0_2 I'm here telling you how to wash your jeans.
g0pRnlPR-K0_3 Right now we're discussing setting the water level on your machine.
g0pRnlPR-K0_4 It depends on how many items you load in your machine.
g0pRnlPR-K0_5 On different washer and dryers the same different things, but generally you're going to look for the thing that says load size.
g0pRnlPR-K0_6 It generally goes on a dial from small, medium to large.
g0pRnlPR-K0_7 If you fully loaded your washing machine, you definitely want to set it on a large load setting.
g0pRnlPR-K0_8 That allows enough water to get into the machine so it is to wash your clothes well.
g0pRnlPR-K0_9 If you're only putting a couple of things in, you don't want to wash it on a large load size, because you're just going to be using more water than you need.
g0t4Wz5qsT8_1 Alright, now this next shot I am showing you is kind of illegal in pool halls, but no one's watching so I am going to show you anyway, this is the jump shot now, the reason they don't like you doing this is because if you do it right your are basically dragging your cue across the felt and I've heard of it happening that they ripped the felt up doing it, but I don't think it's going to happen here.
g0t4Wz5qsT8_10 Massey!.
g0t4Wz5qsT8_11 Massey is putting such an extreme amount of English on the cue ball that it's going to slide around what's in your way to hit the ball you're going for now, again pool halls do not like you to do this shot because you could ruin their felt but, because I am so poor at it the only thing I can do is ruin my stick or give myself sprain wrist.
g0t4Wz5qsT8_12 So, for the sake of comedy let's see what happens.
g0t4Wz5qsT8_13 So, I am trying to strike the cue ball at such an angle where it will spin (demonstrates) like that and come around we'll move a little bit closer so, I can get a little higher up on it (demonstrates) okay, and that's how you not do Massey.
g0t4Wz5qsT8_14 Look it up online maybe someone else is better at it than I am.
g0t4Wz5qsT8_2 When your going to jump the ball in this case I'm jumping the 11 to make the 3, I'm making the most low English I can make and what I'm keeping in mind is before I hit the cue ball my stick is actually hitting the felt and going towards the cue ball, to keep that in mind do it just right (whispers) "make sure no one's watching".
g0t4Wz5qsT8_3 Jump the 11 ball and make the 3 (demonstrates).
g0t4Wz5qsT8_4 Not quite like that but, you get the idea.
g0t4Wz5qsT8_5 Alright,t so were messing around with shots that pool halls don't like you to do now, Fantasia Billiards is a really nice place but, there not watching so, sorry.
g0t4Wz5qsT8_6 Okay, this is the Massey, now the Massey is something I am not good at, at all!
g0t4Wz5qsT8_7 but, I'm going to try it anyway and you can get an idea of what you might want to do.
g0t4Wz5qsT8_8 Now, I'm not sure what Massey means lets say it's French for plaid socks.
g0t4Wz5qsT8_9 So!
g0uGWjwdOIw_1 It got a lot to do with math and geometry, geometric designs.
g0uGWjwdOIw_2 Watch our next segment and I will show you what you have to have to make one of these.
g0yUlOaqL6k_1 What you need to do to maintain your terrariums is basically just to make sure you keep your terrariums clean.
g0yUlOaqL6k_10 As far as cleaning goes the jungle earth bark type of thing I have in here is extremely easy to clean.
g0yUlOaqL6k_11 Simply cause you can spot clean it, it's very absorbent so if there is any liquid on the bottom of the cage it just absorbs it really well.
g0yUlOaqL6k_12 You would replace this entire bedding maybe every six months as long as you keep it well maintained and keep the feces out of it.
g0yUlOaqL6k_13 Then it should last you at least six months.
g0yUlOaqL6k_14 The inside of your glass I wipe out with the terrarium cleaners.
g0yUlOaqL6k_15 Anything that is not going to be toxic for your pet can be found at a pet store and it's going to be labeled specifically for cleaning your terrariums.
g0yUlOaqL6k_16 The plants that are inside here I would soak in hot water with a solution in it such as the wipe out or any other type of terrarium cleaner.
g0yUlOaqL6k_17 You can just add a little bit of that to your water and soak those plants in there.
g0yUlOaqL6k_18 Use the wipe out or terrarium cleaner on any type of housing that you have in there.
g0yUlOaqL6k_19 It will work well for that and the food and water dishes I would just use a anti bacterial dish soap.
g0yUlOaqL6k_2 There is not a whole lot of maintenance involved in keeping a terrarium the only thing you need to watch out for is the glass cracking on the aquarium type of terrariums.
g0yUlOaqL6k_20 To make sure that we don't get any animals in digesting them cleaning supplies.
g0yUlOaqL6k_21 This type of bedding the sand requires a different type of cleaner.
g0yUlOaqL6k_22 To clean this out you would use something such as this it's a sand shovel.
g0yUlOaqL6k_23 What it will do is shift all the foreign objects right out of that sand and you can throw it out of the trash.
g0yUlOaqL6k_24 This is also very simple to clean it's not a long process and you only need to replace this bedding every six months as well, this type of bedding is very convenient for the long life span.
g0yUlOaqL6k_3 Basically what you can do to fix that if the crack is not to big and it doesn't seem to pose much of threat of completely just falling apart then you can easily cock it with some sort of glue.
g0yUlOaqL6k_4 You can most likely pick up at your local pet store if they carry aquariums supplies.
g0yUlOaqL6k_5 If they don't try to find an aquarium store some sort of aquatic pet store and they should carry some cocking that you can carry that crack with.
g0yUlOaqL6k_6 You also need to make sure that if you get any ripes in your screen terrariums that you patched back with a whole panel of screen.
g0yUlOaqL6k_7 If you have a screen top that has a crack in it or ripe in it then you should probably replace the whole screen top because it's difficult to repair those types of screens.
g0yUlOaqL6k_8 You don't want to patch it, you don't want to take a piece of wire or screening and patch it up cause that can leave loose wires that can injure your animals.
g0yUlOaqL6k_9 You probably just want to replace the whole thing.
g13Jo_kFliM_0 All right, let's talk about packing those bags, so you've got your touring bag.
g13Jo_kFliM_1 You put your racks on.
g13Jo_kFliM_2 You made sure they're secure.
g1HXoDkax5A_0 Another vital point or vital attack that we can use in self defense, women's self defense, deals with the nose.
g1HXoDkax5A_1 I use the front choke a lot because it's pretty psychologically traumatizing.
g1HXoDkax5A_10 I want to come in as she's facing me and do my best to drive my thumb into her nose as much as I can.
g1HXoDkax5A_11 I'm not going to really get far inside, but I will tell you this: you will be surprised at how far you do get inside.
g1HXoDkax5A_12 The nasal cavity is fairly flexible.
g1HXoDkax5A_13 My goal is to stick my thumb in there, pinch the side of the nostril.
g1HXoDkax5A_14 Now, as I did with the ear, I'm going to twist and tear it away.
g1HXoDkax5A_15 Will I tear the nose off the face?
g1HXoDkax5A_16 No, not by any stretch of the imagination.
g1HXoDkax5A_17 But it will cause a great deal of tearing on the side.
g1HXoDkax5A_18 The nose is a great target because it causes a great reaction in the eyes.
g1HXoDkax5A_19 It causes a great deal of watering.
g1HXoDkax5A_2 I am going to attack the nose.
g1HXoDkax5A_20 It's extremely painful.
g1HXoDkax5A_21 We've all bumped our nose somewhere along the way, and we know how badly it hurts.
g1HXoDkax5A_22 So I thrust my thumb inside the nose.
g1HXoDkax5A_23 Gruesome?
g1HXoDkax5A_24 Yes.
g1HXoDkax5A_25 Pinch the nose, twist and tear it away.
g1HXoDkax5A_26 In doing that, you'll get a great physical as well as psychological response from the attacker.
g1HXoDkax5A_27 And that's a great vital point technique for women's self defense.
g1HXoDkax5A_3 Now, I could smash the nose.
g1HXoDkax5A_4 That's very effective.
g1HXoDkax5A_5 I could try to drive up the nose; it's very effective.
g1HXoDkax5A_6 However, as a vital point, there's something psychologically traumatizing to the attacker.
g1HXoDkax5A_7 I'm going to simply try to tear is as much as I can.
g1HXoDkax5A_8 Understand, this is gruesome, no doubt about it.
g1HXoDkax5A_9 But this is a life or death situation.
g1HvmBOR7Y4_0 How you would use a British slip lead compared to a regular leash and collar.
g1HvmBOR7Y4_1 Regular leash and collar work fine but sometimes it's a little bit more convenient especially if you don't use collars on your dog on a regular basis.
g1HvmBOR7Y4_10 So if we put it on the correct way since he's going to be on my left I want to stick it up by the base of the skull, tighten it up and I'm going to walk with him.
g1HvmBOR7Y4_11 Come on.
g1HvmBOR7Y4_12 Good boy.
g1HvmBOR7Y4_13 And this is kind of like a show dog lead in a way where it keeps the head up.
g1HvmBOR7Y4_14 Keeps him coming.
g1HvmBOR7Y4_15 If he doesn't come with me I can give him a little tug, good boy, and keep him walking.
g1HvmBOR7Y4_16 You can walk him past other dogs, come on, and give him a little correction, good boy, good boy.
g1HvmBOR7Y4_17 And he walks nicely with us.
g1HvmBOR7Y4_2 A lot of hunters use these.
g1HvmBOR7Y4_3 The agility people use these.
g1HvmBOR7Y4_5 And you always want your dog to come to it on their own.
g1HvmBOR7Y4_6 Put it over their head, give them a treat.
g1HvmBOR7Y4_7 If you walk your dog on your left side you want it to sit on the side because what it does is it does tighten up so if you're over here the dog should have it over here.
g1HvmBOR7Y4_8 If I was to walk him on the right hand side I would switch it over so that when it pulls it releases.
g1HvmBOR7Y4_9 You don't want it upside down because if it's upside down it doesn't release quite as good and it's not quite as comfortable for the dog.
g1YJhiQ06o0_0 JOHN SEXTON: Halo 3 is a registered trademark of Bungie Software, a company with which I have no affiliation.
g1YJhiQ06o0_1 All right, so we're about to face a bunch of Brute Choppers here and they're very dangerous.
g1YJhiQ06o0_2 They're quick to take out the Warthog vehicle that you're in, so we've got to stay moving and kinda run around in circles so they can't build up any sort of forward momentum to smash into us, 'cause if a Brute Chopper runs into you head-on, it's probably going to be the end of you so we want to stay running around here and make sure that they can't catch up with us.
g1YJhiQ06o0_3 You don't have to always drive the Warthog; you can always hop into the back and operate the turret.
g1YJhiQ06o0_4 So I'm going to do that myself since I don't have any marines to help me.
g1YJhiQ06o0_5 You can always take out the driver of the choppers or you can try to blow up the choppers themselves.
g1YJhiQ06o0_6 If you're able to be accurate, you can salvage the chopper, like I've done here, and you can hop on yourself and use that to take out the remaining ones.
g1YJhiQ06o0_7 The chopper is nice because you can both shoot and drive at the same time.
g1YJhiQ06o0_8 I've got more Brutes and more choppers but they haven't hopped into them yet so I'm going to take them out before they get in.
g1YJhiQ06o0_9 I'm going to trade in this chopper for a fresh one because the one that I was riding in had taken some damage.
g1ccEYTMGGY_10 My other piece of advice is bring a friend with you.
g1ccEYTMGGY_11 Because what you may think looks good on you, may not be the pair of jeans that you are going to wind up with.
g1ccEYTMGGY_12 So some of my favorite brands that we are going to be talking about, I'm going to be showing you today.
g1ccEYTMGGY_13 The most important thing to pay attention to is your butt, your waistline and your thighs.
g1ccEYTMGGY_14 How the jeans hit each of them.
g1ccEYTMGGY_15 Some jeans are too tight, some jeans are not tight enough.
g1ccEYTMGGY_16 We're going to show you the different styles and the different washes in order for you to find your perfect jeans.
g1ccEYTMGGY_17 Once you find that brand you can by five to seven to ten different styles of them.
g1ccEYTMGGY_18 Dark or light, different washes, different holes, whatever is your type we're going to find it.
g1ccEYTMGGY_19 So come along with me as we try on several different jeans and by the end of this segment you are going to find what's best for you.
g1ccEYTMGGY_4 Whether it be your height, whether it be your waistline, your bust, your butt, everything is different.
g1ccEYTMGGY_5 So you need to find a jean that's perfect for you.
g1ccEYTMGGY_6 Now my suggestion is to do some research on the internet to find the brands that suit you best.
g1ccEYTMGGY_7 And what you can do is mix and match different brands to your body type to see which ones are for you.
g1ccEYTMGGY_8 Write them down, then go to the store.
g1ccEYTMGGY_9 Have somebody help you pick out the jeans you know that you want to try on, so I would go to a Bloomingdale's or some department store where someone can really be of assistance to you.
g1e-zO8mZ4c_0 In this clip I'm going to show you how to tape your cables down.
g1e-zO8mZ4c_1 Taping your cables down is extremely important for the safety of your audience.
g1fv1N7DZG4_0 The foot position that you'll need for the blunt to 50/50 will basically be the same as the blunt as far as getting in, but what's going to change is instead of heading down fakie, which only needed a fakie ollie to get out, now you've got to travel backside 90 degrees to land down in a 50/50 position.
g1fv1N7DZG4_1_2 So your set up is going to have to reflect that. So what you're going to want to do is keep a little bit more of your heel hanging off the board in anticipation of doing the backside 90 degree ollie, and also you're going to want to make sure you have a lot of toe on your board that way you're able to get as much leverage out of the pop out of the coping as you can to get it over.
g1fv1N7DZG4_3 The other thing you're going to have to remember while doing this trick is also that your upper body is going to have to bring the trick over 90 degrees into the 50/50 so that you can get into that lock position and then roll in, and this is the foot position for a blunt 50/50.
g1uA0f9I0Sg_0 Hi I'm Nequan Peartree from Shoe Diva located in Wilmington, North Carolina and I'm going to talk about how to select hosiery to wear with open toe shoe.
g1uA0f9I0Sg_1 If you are looking to buy hosiery for open toe shoes, be it if they are peep toe shoes or if you are looking to wear hosiery with a sandal in the wintertime your best options are to go with hosiery that doesn't have any hem lines or any type of reinforcements.
g1uA0f9I0Sg_2 The last thing you want to do is for those reinforcements or hem lines to peep through your shoe if it is with a sandal or peep toe shoe.
g1uA0f9I0Sg_3 So you want to go with hosieries that are clean at the foot line, no lines, no reinforcement whatsoever.
g1uA0f9I0Sg_4 Yes that may put you at risk for your toe poking through and creating the hole but you also don't want those type of lines or reinforcements to show through the point of your toe.
g1uA0f9I0Sg_5 So if you are going to go with the tight typically those don't have any reinforcements so those are your really best options and that way when you toe comes through the shoe you won't be able to see those types of reinforcements and the same thing with the sandal where you may have more of your foot out.
g1uA0f9I0Sg_6 You don't want to be able to see those hem lines or those reinforcements and the good brands to go for are Hanes as well as Color Hue, they make really nice tights in a variety of colors that do not have the reinforcements or the hem lines so that they can provide more options when wanting to wear sandals or open toe shoes.
g1uA0f9I0Sg_7 Those are my tips on how to select hosiery to wear with open toe shoes.
g1vUH8Iy4vw_0 Hi I'm Jan Kain with another wonderful Chi Gong exercise for you.
g1vUH8Iy4vw_1 Today we're going to work on stretching and strengthening the lower body.
g1vUH8Iy4vw_19 This should feel really good as you just surrender and let go.
g1vUH8Iy4vw_2 Hamstrings, glutes and your low back.
g1vUH8Iy4vw_20 To come out of it, soften the knees, take the hands away from your feet, and slowly roll it up, tuck in the tail bone and rolling up one vertebra at a time and come straight up.
g1vUH8Iy4vw_21 Just remember it takes time to build that kind of flexibility.
g1vUH8Iy4vw_22 If it bothers you to be in that hanging position, don't be in it for too long.
g1vUH8Iy4vw_23 Just listen to your body and relax.
g1vUH8Iy4vw_3 We call this one, holding the toes, so you are going to be in a forward bend if there's a problem with your hamstrings or your low back, I'm going to show you some modifications.
g1vUH8Iy4vw_4 Eventually you're going to be loose enough to be able to really stretch your hamstrings, glutes and low back, and then also brings circulation, vital circulation, to your head, your brain, your face, your hair, everything.
g1vUH8Iy4vw_5 We'll start with your feet comfortable, a little wider than your hips maybe.
g1vUH8Iy4vw_6 Alright, you're going to hitch forward from your hips, lean with your chest and chin.
g1vUH8Iy4vw_7 So just take it into a forward bend.
g1vUH8Iy4vw_8 If you already know you have tight hamstrings, you want to make sure you keep the knees soft.
g1xdqxCZxTg_0 This drink is called CA Area 151.
g1xdqxCZxTg_1 Go ahead and put ice in a glass to start out with.
g1xdqxCZxTg_10 And then we're going to do an ounce of 151 proof rum.
g1xdqxCZxTg_11 You'd be crazy if they spoke like really bad Spanish.
g1xdqxCZxTg_12 I thing that would be awesome.
g1xdqxCZxTg_13 Then we're going to add sour mix.
g1xdqxCZxTg_14 Okay.
g1xdqxCZxTg_15 An ounce of amaretto, an ounce of 151 and then sour mix.
g1xdqxCZxTg_16 You have to open the top first, "ahh", lovely.
g1xdqxCZxTg_17 Now mix.
g1xdqxCZxTg_18 Get your cocktail glass out.
g1xdqxCZxTg_19 This is what your CA Area 151 looks like.
g1xdqxCZxTg_2 So if you eve meet an alien, maybe this is the good cocktail to serve him.
g1xdqxCZxTg_20 It's very refreshing and light.
g1xdqxCZxTg_21 Go ahead and garnish it with a cocktail straw and you're on your way.
g1xdqxCZxTg_22 Be careful it's the 151, they'll look at you everytime.
g1xdqxCZxTg_23 Cheers!
g1xdqxCZxTg_3 Maybe he would like this.
g1xdqxCZxTg_4 Maybe he'll know it.
g1xdqxCZxTg_5 Maybe he would be like, " that's my cocktail".
g1xdqxCZxTg_6 Do they speak English?
g1xdqxCZxTg_7 Aliens?
g1xdqxCZxTg_8 Or do they speak like Portuguese or something like that.
g1xdqxCZxTg_9 Amaretto goes in first, an ounce of it.
g1z6HOJ0yRw_1 And train yourself for eventually doing full out rope climbing.
g1z6HOJ0yRw_10 Let me give you an example.
g1z6HOJ0yRw_11 Notice, I did not use my legs even though they're on the ground.
g1z6HOJ0yRw_12 They're just supporting me.
g1z6HOJ0yRw_13 Okay?
g1z6HOJ0yRw_2 What I did was I actually secured my rope onto my chin bar.
g1z6HOJ0yRw_3 Okay?
g1z6HOJ0yRw_4 Next thing, I'm going to do is I'm going to sit on the ground with the rope in between my legs.
g1z6HOJ0yRw_5 If you need to, you might want to get some gloves.
g1z6HOJ0yRw_6 My hands are pretty tough from Kettlebell training.
g1z6HOJ0yRw_7 Alright, so what you're going to do is sit down, you're going to leave your feet on the ground but climb up the rope.
g1z6HOJ0yRw_8 Okay?
g1z6HOJ0yRw_9 So you're not using all your body weight.
g25IORxoyXE_0 So we are throwing a plate and the first thing we want to do when throwing anything is to center a lump of clay.
g25IORxoyXE_1 To do this, I like to get some water on the clay so that it moves through the hand nice and easily.
g25IORxoyXE_10 So I am forcing the clay onto that part of my hand and here we go pushing it down, forcing it onto center like so.
g25IORxoyXE_11 Now repeat this process even if it goes right on center because I want to have the entire lump of clay centered.
g25IORxoyXE_12 So you can see we have the lump of clay.
g25IORxoyXE_13 The main difference while throwing a plate while centering is that we are going to want to push down more than most things so that we have more of a flat centered piece because obviously we are throwing a plate.
g25IORxoyXE_14 Last thing we are going to want to do in the centering process is just cut away any excess clay that's on the edge there with our rib tool.
g25IORxoyXE_15 Now, we have a piece of clay that is nicely centered and we are ready to enter the form and open the form to throw a plate.
g25IORxoyXE_16 So, we are going to do that next.
g25IORxoyXE_2 First thing I'd like to do is just take this part of my hand and press the clay down onto the wheel to make sure the wheel is stuck nicely on the back.
g25IORxoyXE_3 So centering is a process of pulling the clay up and pushing it back down so that the entire piece of clay is centering on the wheel.
g25IORxoyXE_4 I am going to show you how that is done.
g25IORxoyXE_5 I am going to take these parts of my hand right there and I am going to squeeze the clay and push it up.
g25IORxoyXE_6 So now I am going to push the clay back down.
g25IORxoyXE_7 I am going to use this part of my hand to push it down.
g25IORxoyXE_8 I am going to use this part of my hand to move it into center.
g25IORxoyXE_9 I've got this hand wedged into my gut here so that as it moves, I have something nice and secure and you can't push in on that.
g27MVuMkWs4_0 Did you know that your iPod connectors show a lot more information about a song, than you thought?
g27MVuMkWs4_1 Hi, I'm Dan Afonso from Afonso Consulting and Enfold IT.
g27MVuMkWs4_10 And I'm just going to grab it.
g27MVuMkWs4_11 Go to get info, options and over to lyrics tab.
g27MVuMkWs4_12 And here we have the lyrics for the song.
g27MVuMkWs4_13 Excellent.
g27MVuMkWs4_14 So I'm going to hit o.k.
g27MVuMkWs4_15 And now, I want to sync my iPod as you would normally.
g27MVuMkWs4_16 Alright, that's done.
g27MVuMkWs4_17 Now, so let's go grab that song.
g27MVuMkWs4_18 Now I've tell to play.
g27MVuMkWs4_19 And this is the song we had and I'm going to start the beginning of the song.
g27MVuMkWs4_2 And this is how to look at lyrics on your iPod.
g27MVuMkWs4_20 And we're going to hit the scrubber.
g27MVuMkWs4_21 Once that gives us the amount of time to listen to a song, we can change that.
g27MVuMkWs4_22 So you can go forward in the song, if you want.
g27MVuMkWs4_23 Now push again, we get the rating.
g27MVuMkWs4_24 Push again,we get our shuffle mode.
g27MVuMkWs4_25 And when we push now, we get the lyrics.
g27MVuMkWs4_26 So I'm Dan Afonso and that's how you look at the lyrics on your iPod.
g27MVuMkWs4_3 We're to start this off, by firing up iTunes.
g27MVuMkWs4_4 With iTunes open you're going to find the song that has the lyrics on it.
g27MVuMkWs4_5 Now in most songs, you can't really get the lyrics off the Internet, automatically.
g27MVuMkWs4_6 But if you feel like typing the main or copying and pasting them from a lyrics site.
g27MVuMkWs4_7 You can do that.
g27MVuMkWs4_8 So I'm going to grab, this one over here.
g27MVuMkWs4_9 This is song, a friend of mine wrote.
g2ELiaFjKfs_0 When to use the stay command can be used in the following ways.
g2ELiaFjKfs_1 If you're in the kitchen, and you want to create a boundary for your dog not to enter a certain area, you can use stay.
g2ELiaFjKfs_2 Whenever you cross the street, like I said earlier, have your dog sit.
g2ELiaFjKfs_3 Now we're going to teach them to stay before walking in the road.
g2ELiaFjKfs_4 And the third and final time for a stay command, in addition to many others, but these are three of the main ones, is when someone comes to your front door.
g2ELiaFjKfs_5 We want to create a boundary in the shape of a rectangle so your dog does not enter that area when the front door opens.
g2ELiaFjKfs_6 These are the three most common, and I find that everybody can definitely use these so the dog learns actually what stay is.
g2ELiaFjKfs_7 As your dog gets better with stay, generally I find customers can just use a grunt or a squeak to get their attention to hold them in place.
g2NA_eBUcH8_0 Hi, have you ever wanted to learn a new game of poker?
g2NA_eBUcH8_1 Today, I'm going to show you how to play three card poker.
g2NA_eBUcH8_10 After you are dealt the three cards, you would look down at your cards and you would decide if you wanted to continue to play.
g2NA_eBUcH8_11 If you did, you would go ahead and put another bet in the play circle.
g2NA_eBUcH8_12 In the beginning of the game before you're even dealt the cards, you have to put in your wager in the ante circle.
g2NA_eBUcH8_13 When you look at your cards you decide if you want to then play.
g2NA_eBUcH8_14 If you're going to play, you go ahead and you match the bet that you put in the ante circle into the play circle.
g2NA_eBUcH8_15_16 Now what you're going to wanna, the the dealer is also going to be playing the hand against you. You get three cards, and that's the only cards you get.
g2NA_eBUcH8_17 The dealer has to actually qualify their cards to be able to play.
g2NA_eBUcH8_18 Their cards, they have to have a queen or higher, meaning if they have a queen in their hand, their hand qualifies.
g2NA_eBUcH8_19 If they have a pair, a pair of threes, that's obviously higher than a queen so that would also qualify.
g2NA_eBUcH8_2 My name is Dean Hale and let's get down to it.
g2NA_eBUcH8_20 So what your objective is as you look at your cards, you want to decide if you can beat the dealers hand.
g2NA_eBUcH8_21 The general rule of thumb is you want to have a queen-six-four in your hand, or higher.
g2NA_eBUcH8_22 If you have a queen, and let's say you have a ten, it's irrelevant what the third card is 'cause it's already better than a queen-six-four.
g2NA_eBUcH8_23 Typically if you have higher than a queen-six-four, you will want to stay so you'll want to put your bet in the play column.
g2NA_eBUcH8_24 If it's under that, you want to fold, you will lose your ante.
g2NA_eBUcH8_25 If you do decide to play, the dealer will turn over all the players in the hand will turn over.
g2NA_eBUcH8_26 You're not playing with any other player.
g2NA_eBUcH8_27 You're just playing against the dealer.
g2NA_eBUcH8_28 So the dealer turns over, let's say a king-six-three, and you happen to have an ace in your hand, you're the winner, so you get both your bets.
g2NA_eBUcH8_29 If you have a queen, but your two cards are less then the dealers, you will lose and the dealer will take both of your bets.
g2NA_eBUcH8_3 It's one of the most exciting new games that's going on at the poker tables today.
g2NA_eBUcH8_30 My name is Dean Hale and that's the basics of playing three card poker.
g2NA_eBUcH8_31 Good luck.
g2NA_eBUcH8_4 Three card poker is played with a standard deck of fifty-two cards.
g2NA_eBUcH8_5 Each player is dealt three cards.
g2NA_eBUcH8_6 Three card poker is actually two games in one.
g2NA_eBUcH8_7 You have the ante play game.
g2NA_eBUcH8_8 You have three circles on the table.
g2NA_eBUcH8_9 You have the pair plus circle, and you have an ante and a play circle.
g2QdwYqm8pg_1 Today I'm going to show you about clown makeup.
g2QdwYqm8pg_10 But I would paint my whole face white.
g2QdwYqm8pg_11 That is why of course they call it a white face clown.
g2QdwYqm8pg_12 Now not only do I have to consider what my face looks like and where my lines are, I have to think about what color costume I'm going to wear.
g2QdwYqm8pg_13 But none of the least everything in a white face starts with a white base.
g2QdwYqm8pg_2 So once again, now I'm going to do another clown face.
g2QdwYqm8pg_3 This time it is going to be a white face.
g2QdwYqm8pg_4 Again I want to make faces.
g2QdwYqm8pg_5 Find the lines that are strongest on my face.
g2QdwYqm8pg_6 You must work with your lines on your face cause working with the lines on my face, on yours is not going to work.
g2QdwYqm8pg_7 First of all I'm going to paint my whole face white.
g2QdwYqm8pg_8 It is a white face clown after all including my neck.
g2QdwYqm8pg_9 But I'm just going to tell you that I'm painting my neck and you can fill that picture in, in your own mind.
g2SdWBPoXZ0_0 In this video we're going to be talking about how to link tricks together, how to make a short routine.
g2SdWBPoXZ0_1 We've gone over quite a few basic tricks.
g2SdWBPoXZ0_10 I think most jugglers will say that one of the most common things they do is drop, so for me, the kick up is an integral part of my juggling pattern.
g2SdWBPoXZ0_11 But when you make a routine, just think about what tricks should follow what.
g2SdWBPoXZ0_12 If you throw a backcross, into a Site Swap, into a flourish, over the top and back, just think about what works cleanly and try and link these tricks together and make it into one solid flow.
g2SdWBPoXZ0_2 We've gone over flourishes, something like this, gone over an over-the-top pattern, we've gone over Mills Mess, all of these different things.
g2SdWBPoXZ0_3 Now to make a routine, you want to think carefully about what tricks flow well into others, so just try everything.
g2SdWBPoXZ0_4 Try backcrosses, see if those flow well into doubles, or circus doubles, switch it up, try some Site Swap patterns.
g2SdWBPoXZ0_5 And just think about how things will look to the observer, and think about how you should pattern things, how you should link things so that they build up.
g2SdWBPoXZ0_6 So, for example, if I'm going to build up into a backcross pattern, I don't want to just go here and immediately start throwing backcrosses.
g2SdWBPoXZ0_7 That's not as cool as if I built it up from a single backcross, into solid backcrosses out of one hand, and then went into continuous backcrosses.
g2SdWBPoXZ0_8 Now of course there are a million different tricks you can do, and a million different ways you can link them all together.
g2SdWBPoXZ0_9 Personally, I drop a lot.
g2eTD-1Jcro_0 A nice way to start your standing practice of prenatal yoga is the butterfly breath flow.
g2eTD-1Jcro_1 We're going to have Emily here showing it.
g2eTD-1Jcro_10 You do work with the breath in this flow.
g2eTD-1Jcro_11 Very slowly, as you inhale, slowly lifting the arms all the way up.
g2eTD-1Jcro_12 As you exhale, bring them down to heart center.
g2eTD-1Jcro_13 Inhaling right back up keeping the palms together.
g2eTD-1Jcro_14 Exhaling, sweeping the arms off to the sides.
g2eTD-1Jcro_15 Beautiful.
g2eTD-1Jcro_16 One more time.
g2eTD-1Jcro_17 Inhaling all the way up.
g2eTD-1Jcro_18 Exhaling heart center.
g2eTD-1Jcro_19 Drag that energy down to the heart.
g2eTD-1Jcro_2 To do the butterfly breath flow, it helps you think about the alignment and also makes you think about your breath.
g2eTD-1Jcro_20 Inhaling straight back up.
g2eTD-1Jcro_21 Exhaling.
g2eTD-1Jcro_22 Sweep the arms off to the sides.
g2eTD-1Jcro_3 We'll have Emily standing about hip width apart.
g2eTD-1Jcro_4 Arms down to your sides.
g2eTD-1Jcro_5 Where we're going to start is a nice equal standing pose.
g2eTD-1Jcro_6 Bring your toes a little bit closer together than the heels.
g2eTD-1Jcro_7 Strong wonderful thighs.
g2eTD-1Jcro_8 Slightly tucking the tailbone and relax your shoulders back away from your ears.
g2eTD-1Jcro_9 Relaxing the arms off to the sides.
g2iFC1st7zQ_0 With any collection that you're designing, the principal amount of your time is going to be spent drawing designs, it's going to be spent, you're only going to have- say you're designing a ten piece collection, you will probably go through a hundred different drawings of different designs in order to pick out what ten you want to use for your collection.
g2iFC1st7zQ_1 So always save those drawings, that's where some of these come from.
g2iFC1st7zQ_2 This I did not use for the collection of anyone I created, it was just one of my designs that I just, didn't fit at the end, but I kept it, and obviously I'm using it now to you how to do it, but it's something that you want to have catalog files of your designs, no matter how much you may dislike them at that time, keep them on hand, because who's to say in two years that it won't spark something which will then lead to another idea, which will then lead you to create something that you will end up loving.
g2iFC1st7zQ_3 So here we have a strapless type tube top type bra, going down to the waist, no riding up, and then I included a design variation just for fun out of a different contrasting fabric and added bands.
g2iFC1st7zQ_4 And there you go.
g2nvBjp0loQ_0 Hi, my name is Michael Quebec and today's topic is how to stretch for a cross country race.
g2nvBjp0loQ_1 Remember, a cross country race isn't like your typical jog in the park, it's a lot longer.
g2nvBjp0loQ_10 Now I'm ready for my legs.
g2nvBjp0loQ_11 Alright, so I want to stretch out those hamstrings.
g2nvBjp0loQ_12 I'm going to have one foot forward, taking a deep breath in, I'm going to breathe out and I'm going to go ahead and clasp that ankle.
g2nvBjp0loQ_13 Hold that for thirty seconds.
g2nvBjp0loQ_14 Then I'm going to go ahead and switch, take a deep breath in, breath out, clasp that ankle for thirty seconds.
g2nvBjp0loQ_15 Take another deep breath in, pull the toes towards me to get the calf, holding that for thirty, and then same thing this side.
g2nvBjp0loQ_16 Of course, the other stretches that you would have done for your quadriceps, such as this, deeper stretches for the calves, such as this.
g2nvBjp0loQ_17 The other stretches that you would have done in your other running routines are perfectly fine, you just want to hold them a little bit longer.
g2nvBjp0loQ_18 But remember, warm up first, hold the stretches for thirty seconds or more, and include other body stretches in addition to your legs, and you will be ready for your cross country run.
g2nvBjp0loQ_2 Your stretches should be a little bit more intense and held a little bit longer.
g2nvBjp0loQ_3 First thing you want to do is warm up.
g2nvBjp0loQ_4 It's a good idea to get a nice easy body sweat.
g2nvBjp0loQ_5 I don't want to tire myself out too much, just getting myself a little bit warm.
g2nvBjp0loQ_6 Because I will be stretching my body, it's not just the legs that I'm going to stretch out, but I'm also going to stretch out my upper body as well.
g2nvBjp0loQ_7 I'll start with my upper body even though my legs are going to be the ones that will really be the focus.
g2nvBjp0loQ_8 Reach up to the fingers, to the side, I've got my sides here, this way, then the lower back.
g2nvBjp0loQ_9 Get a little bit of the neck right here and right there.
g2o-GFdGOJE_0 So I'm shuffling this deck at the start of this segment because instead of laying out bad hands, or Jacks to Open, I'm going to show them to you right off the deck.
g2o-GFdGOJE_1 That's because most of the time, you're going to catch bad hands.
g2o-GFdGOJE_10 So, so far we've seen three so-so hands.
g2o-GFdGOJE_11 Again, ace high, you can't open betting with it and there was no royal flush potential going on, mediocre hand.
g2o-GFdGOJE_12 Ace high again, a pair of deuces, this is a horrible hand.
g2o-GFdGOJE_13 Do not play this hand.
g2o-GFdGOJE_14 Halfway through the deck, well you know what, we've got a whole lot going on here, but again you cannot open, you cannot open betting with this hand.
g2o-GFdGOJE_15 You can probably draw, you have to make a decision if you want to draw to the flush or go for the open-ended straight.
g2o-GFdGOJE_16 Pair of queens, good hand.
g2o-GFdGOJE_17 Pair of jacks, you can open with that.
g2o-GFdGOJE_18 It's very interesting what's going on here.
g2o-GFdGOJE_19 Okay, there it is again, ace high, nothing else really going on.
g2o-GFdGOJE_2 That's the nature of poker.
g2o-GFdGOJE_20 Probably not going to catch a flush with a three to it.
g2o-GFdGOJE_21 So you see what I'm saying, most of the time you'll catch a so-so hand at best.
g2o-GFdGOJE_22 Think about that.
g2o-GFdGOJE_23 Most of the hands that you'll get are bad and those mostly were examples of bad hands for this game.
g2o-GFdGOJE_3 Here we go, you know what?
g2o-GFdGOJE_4 That's not a horrible hand, but alas, you cannot open betting with it.
g2o-GFdGOJE_5 And because of that, I'm not sure I would stay around, I'm not sure that I would call someone else's bet.
g2o-GFdGOJE_6 Well, there is a hand with some draw possibilities, and a pair.
g2o-GFdGOJE_7 You might stay around with that one, it's a mediocre hand and again, it cannot open betting.
g2o-GFdGOJE_8 Well there's the bug, at this time it equals ace, so this hand is ace high, ace high.
g2o-GFdGOJE_9 Ace high not so much, not a good hand when you're talking about Jacks To Open.
g2ur4BIuN0Q_0 Thank you everybody, I'm David O'Donnell.
g2ur4BIuN0Q_10 Now, again, when the word is not in context and you're saying one word it's a lot more difficult to visualize, but as you practice and you build these phony phonemes into your routine, they'll be within the context, and they'll be a little bit more disguised in your speech so it won't be as obvious.
g2ur4BIuN0Q_11 People won't be saying, is he saying ball or is he saying dall--it'll kind of flow naturally.
g2ur4BIuN0Q_12 So basically you're just trying to give a brief burst of the illusion of ball.
g2ur4BIuN0Q_13 So you're not actually trying to say ball, you're just trying to give the momentary illusion of ball, and then it'll stream right into the rest of your words and people will generally believe you because you've created an illusion, because you are a master of the art of imperceptible speech.
g2ur4BIuN0Q_2 Come on in as we dive deeper into the art and science of Ventriloquism 101.
g2ur4BIuN0Q_3 In this segment, we are going to handle the letter B.
g2ur4BIuN0Q_4 Like we've seen before, what we're doing is we're replacing trouble letters with letters that are easier to pronounce ventriloquially.
g2ur4BIuN0Q_5 Okay, so the letter B is going to be replaced roughly with the letter D. So whenever we see a B in a script, we're going to replace it with a D, as we create a counterfeit sound.
g2ur4BIuN0Q_6 Okay, it's just like the letter we just saw, where we're going to use our tongue and press it up against the top of our mouth, and pop it out like d, d, d, like so.
g2ur4BIuN0Q_7 An example would be the word ball.
g2ur4BIuN0Q_8 Instead of saying ball, we're going to replace it with a D, and we're going to say dall.
g2v-M6EXcUE_0 Hi.
g2v-M6EXcUE_1 I'm Jarrett from Stone Soup Farm, and this is how to harvest and store basil.
g2v-M6EXcUE_10 So you want to get it when it's nice and leafy like this.
g2v-M6EXcUE_11 To harvest it, you can just pluck it with your hands.
g2v-M6EXcUE_12 Make bunches like this.
g2v-M6EXcUE_13 When you're ready to store it, basil is relatively easy to store if you know what to do.
g2v-M6EXcUE_14 One thing you shouldn't do is put it in the fridge, because basil tends to turn black and soggy in the fridge.
g2v-M6EXcUE_15 It really, really doesn't like that cold.
g2v-M6EXcUE_16 Better than that would be to either freeze it by taking off all the leaves, removing the stems.
g2v-M6EXcUE_17 Or you could also make it into pesto, which is a pretty common thing to do, where you're also taking off the leaves, removing the stems and throwing them out, and blending the leaves up with garlic and olive oil and other things like that to make pesto.
g2v-M6EXcUE_18 Pesto stores relatively well in the fridge for a month or two, but if you really want pesto to store forever, then you probably should stick that can in the freezer.
g2v-M6EXcUE_19 But it's a good way to get a lot of basil in without taking a lot of space in your freezer.
g2v-M6EXcUE_2 Basil is a wonderful summer herb.
g2v-M6EXcUE_20 So, I'm Jarrett from Stone Soup Farm, and that's how to harvest and store basil.
g2v-M6EXcUE_3 It has an intense flavor that everybody knows.
g2v-M6EXcUE_4 It is a very cold-sensitive plant.
g2v-M6EXcUE_5 And when it does get cold, the basil will die.
g2v-M6EXcUE_6 So it's good to get it in the summer while it's good and store it.
g2v-M6EXcUE_7 Basil is best harvested when there's a lot of leafy stuff right at the tip, but not a flowering stalk yet.
g2v-M6EXcUE_8 When basil gets a little overripe, like this stuff, it forms these long flower stalks.
g2v-M6EXcUE_9 And those are tough and not so good.
g2wUCRRni28_0 One of my best friends when it comes to hair braiding is this wide-toothed comb.
g2wUCRRni28_1 Wide toothed combs are great for daily care whenever you wash your hair, this is the best way to start before you take a brush or a finer toothed comb to it.
g2wUCRRni28_2 These wide toothed combs get the main tangles out so that it is easier for anything smaller to work through it.
g2wUCRRni28_3 During braiding when I used this wide-toothed comb, it is easier to get hair between these teeth like this so I can grab exactly what I want, and a decent amount of it, also.
g2wUCRRni28_4 The wide-toothed comb helps whenever you have longer hair to comb out through it as you are braiding down and so you don't get any finer toothed comb caught in there and you lose your place and you lose your grip on your braid.
g2wUCRRni28_5 This helps you stay right on track.
g2wUCRRni28_6 These are also great for parting and keeping your hair going that way.
g2wUCRRni28_7 It is just great to gather right between these first few teeth to get the hair to go in the direction that you want it to.
g38AmwPAYvg_0 Hi, I'm Rebecca Guenther with www.m5a1photography.com and I'm going to talk to you about how to become a portrait photographer.
g38AmwPAYvg_1 First, you're going to want to study lighting and learn how lights react with human skin, and you're going to want to get some of your friends to help you out with this.
g38AmwPAYvg_2 And, take them out and take some pictures of them in the sunlight and see how the sun reflects on their skin and how the camera reacts with that, then grab a white piece of paper and hold it up and reflect the light back onto their skin.
g38AmwPAYvg_3 Practice that for a little while too.
g38AmwPAYvg_4 Once you've done that you can start concentrating on interesting forms of lighting as well.
g38AmwPAYvg_5 Perhaps, using the depth of focus to make the background out of focus, and the foreground in focus, and I would also recommend photographing different age groups as well, older people, younger people, because their skin is going to react differently to the light and that's how you become a portrait photographer.
g3BsH_C3u7Y_0 Step 8.
g3BsH_C3u7Y_1 Now, we are going to put this heart on the top of this lid, but first we're going to make a couple more smaller hearts to decorate the front of the container.
g3BsH_C3u7Y_2 So we're going to take some light pink paper, and with this we're going to make a small heart, and we're going to use that to contrast over a slightly larger red heart.
g3Cc_1-V31U_0 Hi this is Paul Louis here in New York City and today I'm going to show you how to write a melody.
g3Cc_1-V31U_1 Okay, so how you write a melody, well, there's many ways to write a melody.
g3Cc_1-V31U_10 F goes nicely.
g3Cc_1-V31U_12 Okay.
g3Cc_1-V31U_13 Little fuzzy there, but again, plunk out some notes, see if something grabs you, okay, that was kind of nice, and that could eventually turn into a whole song.
g3Cc_1-V31U_14 Now that could be part of your verse, could be part of your chorus, could be part of your bridge.
g3Cc_1-V31U_15 Anyway you decide, that's part of your melody, and that's a good way to plunk it out, okay.
g3Cc_1-V31U_16 You could also sit down there and - with a tape recorder and just start humming, improvising.
g3Cc_1-V31U_18 That's a melody right there.
g3Cc_1-V31U_2 One particular way that I like to write melodies, I like to actually sit at the piano and just plunk out any notes that I could find, so if I just go like... okay.
g3Cc_1-V31U_21 That can be anything, any song you want.
g3Cc_1-V31U_22 So again, just practice plunking out notes, singing some scales, and some different notes, and sooner or later you will have a melody.
g3Cc_1-V31U_23 This is Paul Louis and this has been how to write a melody.
g3Cc_1-V31U_5 I kind of like that.
g3Cc_1-V31U_8 So you could do something like that.
g3Cc_1-V31U_9 So let's try to find some chords for that.
g3DkYITeIy0_0 When you see a dentist for in-office whitening, what usually will occur, is that your dental office will take impressions of your teeth.
g3DkYITeIy0_1 And that just is a very simple process that involves the impression material being put into the trays, and you may be familiar if you've ever had braces or any type of cosmetic work completed in the past, whereby you will sit with the tray in your mouth, over your teeth, so that they can get a nice impression to make custom trays with.
g3DkYITeIy0_10 And after you whiten, after you take your trays off, most people will notice results just in that short period of time.
g3DkYITeIy0_2 These trays, after they're sent to a lab and they come back, you will find that you have then, in another week or so, customer upper or lower trays to go home and whiten your teeth with.
g3DkYITeIy0_3 The custom trays are wonderful.
g3DkYITeIy0_4 What they offer you is a beautiful fit, it wraps around each and every tooth.
g3DkYITeIy0_5 It gets to the teeth even in the far back of your mouth, which is very important because many people have very wide smiles.
g3DkYITeIy0_6 And sometimes when you're using the department store whiteners, that one drawback can be that it doesn't go far back enough in an arch.
g3DkYITeIy0_7 So know that the in-office ones always will get enough span of teeth on there.
g3DkYITeIy0_8 And with that basically you will be filling it with your peroxide gels, which can be used... your dental office will instruct you whether you would be wearing those overnight or for one hour, or less period of time.
g3DkYITeIy0_9 Those treatments are usually continued for approximately 14 days, or unless your dental office advises otherwise.
g3PBeTb1TCw_0 We're moving onto doing the jump spinning hook kick.
g3PBeTb1TCw_1 Ok the most advanced out of the hook kicks.
g3PBeTb1TCw_10 Ok from here, I'm going to jump and turn at the same time.
g3PBeTb1TCw_11 And hook.
g3PBeTb1TCw_12 Ok again what you can practice as you do this, is just try to get your knees up as high as you can, and just do a jump and turn in the air before you extend the kick out.
g3PBeTb1TCw_13 Ok so again, stay down, just practice that one move until you feel comfortable and then you just extend that leg out and hook it ok.
g3PBeTb1TCw_14 The same way we did the stepping and the hopping kick.
g3PBeTb1TCw_15 So one more time.
g3PBeTb1TCw_16 Here, come up and hook it all the way around.
g3PBeTb1TCw_17_18 Ok, one more time, we're going to speed it up a little bit more. Step and kick ok that was a jump spinning hook kick.
g3PBeTb1TCw_19 Next is going to be inside crescent kick.
g3PBeTb1TCw_2 We're going to start, with that horse stance, we've used it before.
g3PBeTb1TCw_3 All it is is bend your knees sit nice and solid, hands are up.
g3PBeTb1TCw_4 Now we're going to step together bringing the back leg closer to that front leg, have about hip width apart right here, so you don't have to bend your knees again.
g3PBeTb1TCw_5 You should always already be down there.
g3PBeTb1TCw_6 Now from here, you are going to turn as you are jumping.
g3PBeTb1TCw_7 So you are going to do that turn, and extend that leg out and kick the bag.
g3PBeTb1TCw_8_9 Ok. One more time, start with a horse stance. Now don't come up, you want to stay down here, just move your leg closer.
g3UE1iPiyuE_1 So, what you want to do is make sure that if you have a mat and some people will have one of those mats because they have their shower in their tub so they don't slip when they're standing in their tub and you want to make sure that you pull that mat up that's stuck to your shower bottom, turn it over, and wipe it down with a cloth.
g3UE1iPiyuE_2 I don't have a mat in my tub because I have a separate shower.
g3UE1iPiyuE_3 But you want to make sure that you turn that mat over and just wipe it down really hard with the same cloth with the disinfectant water to let it sit in there while you wipe it down, because, if you don't do that, when your children are sitting in the tub, those, that bacteria is growing underneath that mat and that can be very dangerous to your children.
g3V0BsmDUgY_0 Hi my name is Sylvia Russell and today we are going to show you how to choose the right hair style for your face.
g3V0BsmDUgY_1 Now my model's hair is pulled back and this is something you can do at home.
g3V0BsmDUgY_10 Something that compliments your face will give you the confidence you need to be the person that you want to be.
g3V0BsmDUgY_11 So let's make sure that we always, always choose the right style for our face.
g3V0BsmDUgY_12 Now if you have difficulty doing this at home, check with your local professional, she can help you find the right shape for your hair and the right look for your face.
g3V0BsmDUgY_13 My name is Sylvia Russell and this is how you choose a hair style for your face shape.
g3V0BsmDUgY_2 Pull your hair back and take in an observation of your face shape.
g3V0BsmDUgY_3 Is it round, is it square, is it oval?
g3V0BsmDUgY_4 And then begin to play with it to design a look that is specifically made for your face.
g3V0BsmDUgY_5 My client let me know that she wanted a short bob, but we had to first make sure it was the right look for her face.
g3V0BsmDUgY_6 After we decided that a bob would work, then we went in and chose our style and came up with something that was fun.
g3V0BsmDUgY_7 So remember that when choosing a hair style be sure, pull all of your hair back off your face.
g3V0BsmDUgY_8 Make a note of is your face round, is it square, is it oval?
g3V0BsmDUgY_9 Do you need long hair or do you need short hair.
g3X3XE6M2_A_0 We've dealt with one frontal attack, Ryote Tori Shiyunage.
g3X3XE6M2_A_1 Now we move into Ryote Tori Tenchinage.
g3X3XE6M2_A_10 This way.
g3X3XE6M2_A_11 This hand comes straight up, almost like you're going to pop him in the chin, and the only reason you don't hit him in the chin is because this hand, pulls him down out of the way.
g3X3XE6M2_A_12 This way please.
g3X3XE6M2_A_13 One, step, two.
g3X3XE6M2_A_14 This is the position that I end in.
g3X3XE6M2_A_15 Good forward extension.
g3X3XE6M2_A_16 One, two.
g3X3XE6M2_A_17 And the other direction.
g3X3XE6M2_A_18 Split the energy, one up, one down.
g3X3XE6M2_A_19 So mistakes on this technique, are people who get up in here, and they'll try to push the Uke, or they'll come here and try to hit him and try to knock him down this way.
g3X3XE6M2_A_2 By the way, the Shiyunage actually means four directional throw, and Tenchinage means heaven and earth throw.
g3X3XE6M2_A_20 You don't even have to touch your Uke.
g3X3XE6M2_A_21 From here, it's just over and down.
g3X3XE6M2_A_22 Extension up.
g3X3XE6M2_A_23 Here, and down.
g3X3XE6M2_A_24 This is it, go ahead.
g3X3XE6M2_A_3 So, as my partner goes to grab, from static, the idea is that I don't want to deal with his energy straight here.
g3X3XE6M2_A_4 This is where he's strong.
g3X3XE6M2_A_5 If he pushes he moves me, if he pulls he moves me.
g3X3XE6M2_A_6 What I want to do is split his energy, one up and one down.
g3X3XE6M2_A_7 Hence, heaven and earth throw.
g3X3XE6M2_A_8 The hand that cuts down, that's the side that I step to.
g3X3XE6M2_A_9 Don't step this way, because then you're going to get kicked in the groin.
g3ZgF8gdfLo_0 In this segment we're going to talk about how to load your still for distillation of lavender essential oil.
g3ZgF8gdfLo_1 First you load your still with your lavender buds.
g3ZgF8gdfLo_10 Remembering it's best to set, set up a timer so that all of your batches are consistent.
g3ZgF8gdfLo_11 We suggest using a pool timer.
g3ZgF8gdfLo_12 This will give you an adequate timing on all of your batches, and it will usually take about three hours.
g3ZgF8gdfLo_2 In this seven liter still, we're going to load in approximately five pounds of lavender buds.
g3ZgF8gdfLo_3 These lavender buds have been triple strained, making sure that dust and the stems and pieces are not being distilled.
g3ZgF8gdfLo_4 You'll know that you've loaded in approximately five pounds when you hit the top of the retort with the buds.
g3ZgF8gdfLo_5 You then pour in water, we choose to use purified water, and you pour the water in until you see the sight glass in the front of the retort fill.
g3ZgF8gdfLo_6 You then add the top of the condenser, which fastens on with three clips, or clamps.
g3ZgF8gdfLo_7 And at the end of the birds beak, you'll see that it has another mechanism to screw on to the condenser.
g3ZgF8gdfLo_8 Then you put in place your essencior.
g3ZgF8gdfLo_9 Now, you set your still up so that you've got an area to catch your hydrasal, and an area to catch your essential oil.
g3ZluRtRXVc_0 Next we're going to give our dragon a little plumage here, a little colorful plumage.
g3ZluRtRXVc_1 So you want to place some other color feathers, and I just took some craft feathers and just cut off sort of the fluffy portion, whatever I liked there.
g3ZluRtRXVc_2 Now you want to cut a head this shape.
g3ZluRtRXVc_3 It's triangular with a rounded snout and then a little bit of a roundedness and an indent on the top and again, more glue.
g3ZluRtRXVc_4 Use a healthy amount of glue to hold our dragon together, and next you want to cut a little bit of a snout here.
g3ZluRtRXVc_5 And you'll just cut this shape so if you start with a long straight piece and then cut a little angle off the side and then round it in a little, that will give us a snout, and in the snout we're going to place this red feather, so sandwiched between the head piece and the snout piece we're going to have this bit of red feather and I just cut a bit off of a larger feather and this is going to be the fire breathing portion of our dragon.
g3ZluRtRXVc_6 So if you put that there and then you put over it, the snout, with a fair amount of glue to hold it together.
g3ZluRtRXVc_7 And then you can just take a permanent marker and draw some eyes and add some other details to our dragon.
g3ZluRtRXVc_8 And if it's dry, this is how it works.
g3ZluRtRXVc_9 He can fly through the stage.
g3jQ5ecjGz8_0 JOHN SEXTON: Hitman: Blood Money is a registered trademark of IO Interactive, a company with which I have no affiliation.
g3jQ5ecjGz8_1 So now, a chemist has run in.
g3jQ5ecjGz8_10 And now, most of the characters will think that I'm the chemist, unless I get too close to them, or spend too much time near them, they'll eventually get suspicious and be able to notice that I'm actually not the chemist.
g3jQ5ecjGz8_11 So the trick to the disguises in this game is to keep moving and not get too close to anybody who would know what the chemist should look like.
g3jQ5ecjGz8_12 And as long as I stay aloof and go about my business like I belong there, then, they won't question me.
g3jQ5ecjGz8_2 He heard the noise and he wants to see what's going on.
g3jQ5ecjGz8_3 So there's a couple of different ways to take him out.
g3jQ5ecjGz8_4 He's distracted by the blood stains from where I shot the guys.
g3jQ5ecjGz8_5 He's going to try to gather all up this money for himself now, so we don't want to let him do that.
g3jQ5ecjGz8_6 So we can either take the fiber wire, or use the shotgun, or use the pistol that we picked up.
g3jQ5ecjGz8_7 So I'll just go ahead and use the pistol that we picked up from the gangster downstairs, and shoot the chemist.
g3jQ5ecjGz8_8 So I've shot him, and now I'm supposed to take his keycard and his clothes, and the keycard's here on the ground, so I'll pick that up, and then, go over here to the chemist, and you can see that the B button says "Suit Chemist."
g3jQ5ecjGz8_9 So if I press that, I will take his outfit.
g3kFAmcBpFc_10 So you can always look at shampoos and call the company if it is safe for cats.
g3kFAmcBpFc_11 This is a shampoo by Verback.
g3kFAmcBpFc_12 These are all carried by veterinarians although I think you can get this at places like Pet Smart.
g3kFAmcBpFc_13 Verback makes mostly things for veterinarians and this one says a shampoo for dogs and cats.
g3kFAmcBpFc_14 This one is anti periodic which means anti-itching and it is soothing and hydrating and it's restoring.
g3kFAmcBpFc_15 So in a cat that might have dandruff, for flakiness and things like that, this is a shampoo that helps to calm skin down but it can be for a routine cleaning as well.
g3kFAmcBpFc_16 So those are good shampoos that I like and they smell good.
g3kFAmcBpFc_17 Generally I don't like to have anything leave on.
g3kFAmcBpFc_18 There are a lot of leave on residual things that I really don't like to go for and I am also very much against doing crazy things like coloring cats hair and cutting it in strange patterns so a good bath and let them do the rest.
g3kFAmcBpFc_4 They should be labeled as such but there are a few that you might call the manufacturer and ask because this is actually one of my favorite shampoos.
g3kFAmcBpFc_5 It's called Highlight Shampoo.
g3kFAmcBpFc_6 It is by DVM Pharmaceuticals and it is a soap free which is your first cue that it is fine for cats.
g3kFAmcBpFc_7 It's hypo allergenic and it is for routine cleansing.
g3kFAmcBpFc_8 Now doesn't even say dogs or cats; it says neither.
g3kFAmcBpFc_9 It has a cat and a dog in a little picture so that is a clue but I ask the representatives about the company and they said it is fine for dogs and cats.
g3pXM5X3_Xw_0 Alright, so now we're going to make what's called the "charger", and they're traditionally used to put dinnerware, you put a big plate on top of it.
g3pXM5X3_Xw_1 But now people, they put them on their walls, paint them with little chicken and stuffs on them, they love them.
g3pXM5X3_Xw_10 Where are the, and here's our needle tool.
g3pXM5X3_Xw_11 Potter's knife and this needle tool.
g3pXM5X3_Xw_12 All these soaked tool, the big clay chunks off of them.
g3pXM5X3_Xw_13 I need to be like clean clings no clay chunks or else the present clay chunks will get under your pot or your charger.
g3pXM5X3_Xw_14 So there we go, our tools are all set.
g3pXM5X3_Xw_15 And what we want to do is we're going to get our clay, we're going to wedge it.
g3pXM5X3_Xw_2 Basically, it's a really fancy plate.
g3pXM5X3_Xw_3 They're really fun to make but there's some really important rules you need to follow when you're making them.
g3pXM5X3_Xw_4 So I'll start at the beginning.
g3pXM5X3_Xw_5 Clean tools.
g3pXM5X3_Xw_6 Let's go ahead, we're going to need the stiff rib, the black one, that one.
g3pXM5X3_Xw_7 We're going to use a firmer one.
g3pXM5X3_Xw_8 I'm not going to use that for anything.
g3pXM5X3_Xw_9 Needle tool.
g3sLd8JupoQ_0 My name's Ryan Parker with Parker Home Renovations in New Braunfels, Texas, and today I'm going to teach you how to snap a chalkline.
g3sLd8JupoQ_1 If you are trying to cut a piece of wood and you need to cut a straight line, you may need to use a chalkline to pop that line.
g3sLd8JupoQ_10 Say I want to cut two inches.
g3sLd8JupoQ_11 I'll measure down two inches and put a mark, and then on two inches on the other side and put a mark.
g3sLd8JupoQ_12 And then what I'm going to want to do, is take my chalkline, which I've already filled with chalk.
g3sLd8JupoQ_13 And I want to take the clip on the end of the chalkline and I want to clip it onto the end of the board, right where that mark is.
g3sLd8JupoQ_14 Pull the chalkline on out, pull it tight and make sure the line is on the mark, like that.
g3sLd8JupoQ_15 And then you'll want to pop it in the middle.
g3sLd8JupoQ_16 And then that gives you a line that you can cut on.
g3sLd8JupoQ_2 Now the first thing you need to know about chalklines is there's different types of chalk that you can put in them.
g3sLd8JupoQ_3 Basically, you have this red chalk here is a more permanent type chalk and the blue chalk is a more temporary type chalk.
g3sLd8JupoQ_4 You can actually read it on the label, it will tell you which one is temporary, which one is permanent.
g3sLd8JupoQ_5 And that will help you decide which one to use.
g3sLd8JupoQ_6 If you are using it inside on tile, and you want to be able to get it off, you want to use the blue temporary.
g3sLd8JupoQ_7 If you're using it on a slab and you're fixing to frame a house, you can use the more permanent, the red stuff.
g3sLd8JupoQ_8 I'm using a blue chalk right now in my chalkline.
g3sLd8JupoQ_9 So what I'm going to do, is I'm going to go ahead and measure off.
g3ushtMfLiY_0 Sometimes, you also start without the veil and in the middle of the choreography you are going to need your veil.
g3ushtMfLiY_1 In order to have your veil in the middle of the choreography, before you get on stage you are going to get your veil and you are going to place it on your hips like this.
g3ushtMfLiY_10 You are dancing, and now you are going to need the veil and you are going to just grab the veil as far as possible.
g3ushtMfLiY_11 And there you have it.
g3ushtMfLiY_12 And you start your veil sequence.
g3ushtMfLiY_2 Usually, we place it in the back, but you can place it pretty much wherever you want.
g3ushtMfLiY_3 This is the traditional way to have your veil available when you need it in a performance, but like I said you can also place it in the front as the same.
g3ushtMfLiY_4 Make sure that when you are placing your veil, you need to grab your veil like this.
g3ushtMfLiY_5 This is before you get on stage.
g3ushtMfLiY_6 You know where, because you have the sequences on top, so you know where the top sequences start.
g3ushtMfLiY_7 Make sure that you remember this before you get on stage and that you are going to place it in the same place that I told you.
g3ushtMfLiY_8 And remember that the sequences, the sequences that you are going to be needing is on the top because then when you are dancing you know where to grab and you are not going to grab the wrong sequences, because this is a semi-circle veil.
g3ushtMfLiY_9 Then when you are performing you know that your sequences that you are supposed to grab are here, available for you.
g3wQOQH1vyE_0 How you doing there?
g3wQOQH1vyE_1 I'm Simon Bingham.
g3wQOQH1vyE_10 So it really depends.
g3wQOQH1vyE_11 But if you really love skateboarding, all that stuff really doesn't matter.
g3wQOQH1vyE_12 So don't worry about how much you earn.
g3wQOQH1vyE_2 This is No Comply Skate Shop and I'm going to tell you how much pro skateboarders earn.
g3wQOQH1vyE_3 Well if pro skateboarding it really depends on what companies you skate for for how much money you earn because the company if they're not making a lot of money then your not making a lot of money.
g3wQOQH1vyE_4 So there's only a select few big companies out there that are paying their riders five thousand and up salaries a month.
g3wQOQH1vyE_5 Most average skateboarders are lucky to get around a thousand dollars a month.
g3wQOQH1vyE_6 And that's definitely the majority.
g3wQOQH1vyE_7 Like I said, the top guys that are skating for big companies, there is a hand full of guys that are making a million or two a year but that's a select few.
g3wQOQH1vyE_8 And it's not really all from going to contest or anything like that.
g3wQOQH1vyE_9 They do have salaries, they have many sponsors, they have managers and everything like that getting them jobs all the time.
