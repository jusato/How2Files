-d5dN54tH2E_0 We're going to work on a arm drill that will help you have graceful hand movements in front of you.
-d5dN54tH2E_1 I call it painting the wall.
-d5dN54tH2E_10 So we're going to go up and down; let's switch hands, down and up; down and up.
-d5dN54tH2E_11 And just let those fingers relax.
-d5dN54tH2E_12 Now together you're going to go opposite.
-d5dN54tH2E_13 Do it very mechanically at first and then slowly soften it out as you feel comfortable.
-d5dN54tH2E_14 It's real easy to actually get your fingers to lead, so try not to let them do that.
-d5dN54tH2E_15 Let the wrist do all the leading.
-d5dN54tH2E_2 So this one what you're going to start with, let's take one hand first; it's going to, the wrist is going to come down and the wrist is going to come up.
-d5dN54tH2E_3 So basically your wrist is going to be leading the movement, and let the fingers follow nice and relaxed where the wrist is going.
-d5dN54tH2E_4 Don't let the fingers take over, let the wrist do all the guiding.
-d5dN54tH2E_5 Let's make sure that are feet are parallel and are knees are soft.
-d5dN54tH2E_6 Our belly buttons pulled in pressing in towards our spine and our chest is lifted, and our arms are relaxed; are shoulders are nice and relaxed.
-d5dN54tH2E_7 So let's start with the one hand going up and down.
-d5dN54tH2E_8 We're going to keep this right in front of us; you don't want to have it in front of your face so you block yourself.
-d5dN54tH2E_9 You want it right in front of your solar plexus.
-f1_kdl050s_0 In this clip we are going to talk about dangers for these birds in the household and otherwise.
-f1_kdl050s_1 The number one loss for these birds, is flight.
-f1_kdl050s_10 You need to be very careful when cleaning their cages if these birds are flighted.
-f1_kdl050s_11 It seems to be the number one way to loose them.
-f1_kdl050s_12 Once they get loose outside, predators will get to them very quickly.
-f1_kdl050s_13 These guys are not suited to live in the United States, they are not native here and they don't survive.
-f1_kdl050s_14 The other dangers you need to worry about, is Teflon pans.
-f1_kdl050s_15 If they are heated to a high temperature, they give off some fumes that the birds inhale which causes them basically to fell off their perch dead.
-f1_kdl050s_16 There is nothing that you can do about it and it is very quickly.
-f1_kdl050s_17 It is kind of a silent killer.
-f1_kdl050s_18 So, if you have them in the kitchen and if you are going to cook with Teflon, move them to another room in the house, so that you can protect them.
-f1_kdl050s_19 Aerosols, spraying for bugs, spraying perfumes around the house, all those sort of things, these birds have very very sensitive upper repository tracts and so if you have any sort of aerosol it can irritate their lungs.
-f1_kdl050s_2 If these guys are flighted, you need to be really careful if you have them loose in your household.
-f1_kdl050s_20 And, these guys only have a few breaths before they'll die.
-f1_kdl050s_21 So you need to be very careful with aerosols around the house.
-f1_kdl050s_22 And lastly, they are so so tiny, basically anything in your house, a dog, a cat, anything, they can get squished in a door, if they get mouthed, even a little tiny bit by your dog or cat, or by your kid, they will just squished.
-f1_kdl050s_23 There is not a whole lot to them, they are not that robust, they are mostly feathers.
-f1_kdl050s_24 You have to be fairly careful with these birds.
-f1_kdl050s_25 At least in a physical way.
-f1_kdl050s_26 Those are most of your household dangers.
-f1_kdl050s_27 And again, if you are cooking and the birds are loose, be careful with them landing on a hot pan.
-f1_kdl050s_28 You don't want toilet seats open if they are flying around your house because they can fly in it and drowned.
-f1_kdl050s_29 Just be careful, you want to make sure that if you ever let these guys loose out of their cage, you basically bombproof your house.
-f1_kdl050s_3 A lot of these birds aren't tame.
-f1_kdl050s_30 You make sure that every little nook and cranny has been looked at for.
-f1_kdl050s_31 And, if they are alone in their cages and if you have smaller pets and it is a smaller cage, they cannot knock their cage over and let either the bird to fly out or they can't reach through the bars.
-f1_kdl050s_32 Like a cat might dig through the bars if they are small enough and be able to grab hold of the bird.
-f1_kdl050s_33 And, if the bird is outside if you let these guys outside to get some fresh sunshine, raccoons have been known to break into their cages and tear through the bars and ripped into these guys.
-f1_kdl050s_34 So you have to be very careful if you leave them outside for any period of time.
-f1_kdl050s_35 That more or less covers it, just be careful because your birds are very small and much more sensitive to chemicals then many other pets are.
-f1_kdl050s_4 People get them and they only have two or three of them.
-f1_kdl050s_5 As you are opening the cage doors to clean their cages these guys will get startled and fly away.
-f1_kdl050s_6 And when they panic, they fly and they don't come back.
-f1_kdl050s_7 They fly out your windows.
-f1_kdl050s_8 They fly out your front door.
-f1_kdl050s_9 You will be thinking that every thing is sealed and you go clean the papers and your daughter, son, husband walks in through the front door and that bird just flies right out.
00dWJ4YRRSI_0_1 I hope this becomes very popular, here of late, is the circle hooks. Now, circle hooks has been used by Japanese fishermen and longliners for years and years, but in recent years, they've developed lighter, smaller, in shore type hooks, which are very well suited, particularly to folks that are in to the hook and release type fishing.
00dWJ4YRRSI_2 This hook, basically is designed, to catch the fish in the corner of the mouth.
00dWJ4YRRSI_3 Now this type of hook, when you get a bite, you can't jerk the rod to set the hook.
00dWJ4YRRSI_4 You basically just reel down, and get the line tight, and the fish will take off, and when he does, he usually turns, and this hook comes right in the corner of his mouth, and it sort of acts, really like a, kind of like a bottle opener.
00dWJ4YRRSI_5 Once you get it in there, it is very difficult to remove this hook, so if you catch a lot of fish, when you hook up the fish, you rarely ever lose them because of that particular mechanism.
00dWJ4YRRSI_6 The nice thing about the circle hook is, you don't gut hook a lot of fish.
00dWJ4YRRSI_7 You don't damage a lot of fish.
00dWJ4YRRSI_8 You simply get him up to the boat.
00dWJ4YRRSI_9 If you want to release him, you can release him, or cut the hook out, and it's a pretty, it's a pretty friendly hook, for fishing.
0oGfy530AuI_0 MICHAEL ROSENGART: Thrusters.
0oGfy530AuI_1 Right now, we're going to get into a more complicated exercise.
0oGfy530AuI_10 Jonesy is going to sit back.
0oGfy530AuI_11 And as he drives up, again, driving on his heel, driving his hips forward is the work from his hips that will then force the arms up.
0oGfy530AuI_12 Good.
0oGfy530AuI_13 And then there's a lot of arm strength involved to stabilize the dumbbell right above his shoulders.
0oGfy530AuI_14 Not out to the side, not back, but right above.
0oGfy530AuI_15 That's good.
0oGfy530AuI_16 Good work, Jonesy.
0oGfy530AuI_17 Again working from the heels up, work with your breath; feel that you're driving your hips forward and up each time, good work.
0oGfy530AuI_18 Do ten of those and we're going to take a three to five minute break, and then come back to it.
0oGfy530AuI_19 Again, I want to make sure that you understand that when you're doing the thruster that it's working from the ground up, and it is one smooth movement.
0oGfy530AuI_2 We're integrating more of the body.
0oGfy530AuI_20 It's not segmented.
0oGfy530AuI_21 It's not the squat and a shoulder press, okay?
0oGfy530AuI_22 It's one smooth movement.
0oGfy530AuI_23 Try it.
0oGfy530AuI_3 And we're going to develop more strength because we're getting more of the body parts working together at the same time in cohesion.
0oGfy530AuI_4 Okay.
0oGfy530AuI_5 So, Jonesy, you want to go ahead and show what a thruster is?
0oGfy530AuI_6 Jonesy going to take a couple of dumbbells, bring it up to his shoulders.
0oGfy530AuI_7 And we're, basically, he's going to sit back into a squat.
0oGfy530AuI_8 And we're basically combining a squat and a shoulder press, but it's not that simple.
0oGfy530AuI_9 It's not segmented like that.
0pKzG0RRUz4_0 Another technique is you can braid the hair on first and then start wrapping cause some people have really short hair and we can create the look with adding the hair end.
0pKzG0RRUz4_1 So no matter what the length of your hair, long as it's long enough to add a, at the hair on, we can start by braiding it on, then braid, then wrap and you can make this as thick as you like, whatever size you like, whatever color you like.
0pKzG0RRUz4_2 I like the lock extensions because it's not damaging to your hair at all, because you can add color without actually coloring your hair, you just wrap on a different color.
0pKzG0RRUz4_3 I really like that.
0pKzG0RRUz4_4 You can get instant length, which I love.
0pKzG0RRUz4_5 And, we have a skinny one and we have a little fatter one.
0pKzG0RRUz4_6 And we can them even fatter.
0pKzG0RRUz4_7 Whatever length, we can just keep on adding hair forever and ever and it will just go on and on.
0pKzG0RRUz4_8 We can make them as long as we want.
0zvsqf23tmw_1 And in this segment, I'm going to just start paint in the background color.
0zvsqf23tmw_10 I'm going to start on the edge so I can get the edge painted in against the skyline.
0zvsqf23tmw_11 I'm just doing a dark hill here.
0zvsqf23tmw_12 I'm trying to define the edges and then kinda just dry-brush it to fill it in a little bit.
0zvsqf23tmw_13 I don't want too much paint on the wall.
0zvsqf23tmw_14 And you really don't need to use a lot of paint.
0zvsqf23tmw_15 You don't need a lot of paint on your brush.
0zvsqf23tmw_16 You want to just kinda take it easy and then use more paint as you start filling in your details.
0zvsqf23tmw_17 So right now, we're just kinda put a tiny bit of paint on there.
0zvsqf23tmw_18 And this entire mural is going to kinda fade in to the wall.
0zvsqf23tmw_19 It's not going to be a wall-to-wall mural so I just want to make sure that I use less paint the farther out that I go.
0zvsqf23tmw_2 And when you do a children's wall mural, you probably most likely want to always start with, like, your sky first.
0zvsqf23tmw_3 You want to do your background before you get all your objects and those are--it should always be last.
0zvsqf23tmw_4 So what I've got here is I've got a little bit of Benjamin Moore acrylic paint and I've got it in a--it's a flat paint.
0zvsqf23tmw_5 And I've also got a cheap brush and I'm just going to kinda dry-brush it a little bit onto the wall.
0zvsqf23tmw_6 And I'm not going to do way solid onto the wall.
0zvsqf23tmw_7 I'm just going to start kinda tapping it on and getting the wall color on there.
0zvsqf23tmw_8 And if I need to mix it down a little bit then I can always use a little bit of medium or a little bit of water to dilute it.
0zvsqf23tmw_9 And I'll just keep painting on here.
1-xK5UtDSmE_0 We're going to look at it from several aspects and the first thing that I would want to speak to would be the owner of the business, the CEO and in my profession, and I work for a company that provides wellness programs.
1-xK5UtDSmE_1 We've been doing this for a number of years and have been quite successful at producing results.
1-xK5UtDSmE_10 Another one would be eating a proper diet.
1-xK5UtDSmE_11 And you know when we got to that, I said, you know it's not just eating the right foods but it's also eliminating some of the bad foods.
1-xK5UtDSmE_12 And I said, you know like ice cream, ice cream is great but if you eat ice cream all the time, it's got so much sugar in it it's really going have an effect, and the president said whoa, you can't go there, that's my favorite food.
1-xK5UtDSmE_13 And so then I said well, maybe soda would be something that you would start with as.
1-xK5UtDSmE_14 And he said whoa wait, the vice president said we can't go there because you know because he's addicted to soda.
1-xK5UtDSmE_15 And so the net after our presentation I called back and I wasn't getting any callbacks.
1-xK5UtDSmE_16 We want a wellness program but we really don't want to lead.
1-xK5UtDSmE_17 But when you think about that, is that going to get the job done for you.
1-xK5UtDSmE_18 So I speak to you Mr. CEO, Mr. corporate owner, Mr. corporate president, you that are trying to produce something positive in your company, you need to pay attention to your own health.
1-xK5UtDSmE_19 Think about it, if you have a heart attack, if you are hit with cancer, what is that going to do to your organization?
1-xK5UtDSmE_2 And so the real key to it is you Mr. CEO, you Mr. owner of the business and why would that be.
1-xK5UtDSmE_3 Well if you are not healthy, can you have a healthy organization?
1-xK5UtDSmE_4 If you are not setting the example, if you are not being the leader then who's going to lead.
1-xK5UtDSmE_5 I've spoken with several different companies and I can remember one particular bank president in his senior vice president, we sat down together and we started to talk about the subject of, because he wanted a wellness program, that's why I was there.
1-xK5UtDSmE_6 And so we started talking about it and I said to him, well you know there are certain things that are required to have a really a healthy group of employees.
1-xK5UtDSmE_7 And I said well one of them would be exercise.
1-xK5UtDSmE_8 You are going to have to have someway of getting your employees involved with regular exercise.
1-xK5UtDSmE_9 Another one is drinking water, we're going to get into these in a little more detail.
11JT4jRNI-o_0 Let's go to the squat position now and add the tubing into that.
11JT4jRNI-o_1 Again, so many variations.
11JT4jRNI-o_10 The key on this one, and something to keep in mind on this position, is this.
11JT4jRNI-o_11 If you're tubing is really tight, you might not be able to get up unless your legs are close together.
11JT4jRNI-o_12 A squat position, close together, doesn't work very well.
11JT4jRNI-o_13 So the key on something like this, is that your tubing, what you've purchased, or what you have, has enough flexibility, that when you stand on it, you can really stand wide.
11JT4jRNI-o_14 But it's definitely a great exercise, and I highly recommend it.
11JT4jRNI-o_2 I'm going to show you something simple and basic.
11JT4jRNI-o_3 I've got my feet about shoulder width apart, pretty much have to, to do a descent squat.
11JT4jRNI-o_4 I'm going to take my tubing up, and I'm going to open up my palms so they're facing forward.
11JT4jRNI-o_5 What am I doing with this?
11JT4jRNI-o_6 As I go down and up in a squat position, I have to resist the tubing, right?
11JT4jRNI-o_7 It's trying to keep me from coming up.
11JT4jRNI-o_8 As I stretch the tubing straight up and down, it makes the squat harder.
11JT4jRNI-o_9 Once again, you don't want to bend forward too much on this.
1G8LIWgKLME_0 To begin your dotted nail art you're going to need to use a stylus also known as a dotter.
1G8LIWgKLME_1 A stylus comes with different size rounded ends on it anywhere ranging from very small to very large.
1G8LIWgKLME_2 There's also sizes in between depending on the design you're wanting to do.
1G8LIWgKLME_3 For a very small intricate design like an "i" you're going to want to use the smallest size that you have where as if you're wanting to do something large such as the sun you're going to want to use the largest end that you have.
1G8LIWgKLME_4 There's also sizes if you wanted to do things like buttons or just small designs like that.
1G8LIWgKLME_5 For your polish color you're going to want to use a polish that is either complimentary or contrasting.
1G8LIWgKLME_6 I prefer contrasting just so that the design actually sticks out and stands better and so that it is more easily available to be seen.
1QmgK8f5JnY_0 Hello, my names Rebecca Herrick, I'm a licensed massage therapist in Wilmington, North Carolina and I'm here to give my review on Massage Parlors.
1QmgK8f5JnY_1 First of all Massage Parlor is a very dated term and often has some negative connotations that are associated with it and as a massage therapist we worked hard to kind of steer away from that and, you know, work, hard to get the respect that the therapeutic aspect of massage therapy deserves.
1QmgK8f5JnY_2 So, having said that, when you're looking for a place to have a massage you can call it a massage therapy center, or a wellness center, something of that nature, and when you're doing so you want to always make sure that you check the background of the location and also of the therapist practicing there.
1QmgK8f5JnY_3 You always want to make sure that you get the highest quality care by receiving massage from the most educated and absolutely licensed therapist.
1QmgK8f5JnY_4 You can check with local networks, newspapers, other massage therapists in the area, for reviews on massage therapy centers in your area and that would be my take on massage parlor reviews.
1V-aOg8wCT4_10 Now, lets not forget your charity or event website.
1V-aOg8wCT4_11 This is a great place to promote your sponsors as well.
1V-aOg8wCT4_12 You can do this through banners, links to their website, or actual ads on your site promoting the sponsor.
1V-aOg8wCT4_13 Finally, I hope you're going to hand out lots and lots of flyers.
1V-aOg8wCT4_14 A flyer is a great way to promote the sponsor.
1V-aOg8wCT4_15 Again, depending on the level, they might just get their website listed.
1V-aOg8wCT4_16 If it's a large sponsor, they can have their logo or their full ad.
1V-aOg8wCT4_17 The more colorful and bright the flyer the better.
1V-aOg8wCT4_18 Remember sponsors are looking for potential customers, promotion, and publicity.
1V-aOg8wCT4_19 Also remember a happy sponsor is sure to come back year after year after year.
1V-aOg8wCT4_2 How can I create great sponsorships for my golf tournament you cry?
1V-aOg8wCT4_3 Well, no worries because that's exactly what this segment is about.
1V-aOg8wCT4_4 Let's take a look at some of the perks you can offer potential sponsors.
1V-aOg8wCT4_5 To begin with, you can utilize your very own golf program that you're going to be printing.
1V-aOg8wCT4_6 Now, depending on the size of the sponsorship, you can offer quarter page, half page, or full-page ads.
1V-aOg8wCT4_7 Title sponsors might get advertisement on the front the back cover of the actual program.
1V-aOg8wCT4_8 Another great perk; offer a vendor table at the event.
1V-aOg8wCT4_9 Companies will love the idea that they get to interact with the actual golfers at the event.
1aJwX9nRlmk_0 ELIZABETH ROSE: The next thing we're going to do is bring some movement into this area with all the tension, where your headache is happening.
1aJwX9nRlmk_1 So, I'm going to put my hair back, so that you guys can see it, it's a little bit easier.
1aJwX9nRlmk_10 Again, when you're here, the shoulders aren't creeping up.
1aJwX9nRlmk_11 They're still melting down on either side of the spine.
1aJwX9nRlmk_12 You're going to inhale, think of breathing into the back of the neck and between the shoulder blades, and exhale.
1aJwX9nRlmk_13 Stick with your 3-part breath into the belly, into the ribcage, and then into the heart.
1aJwX9nRlmk_14 Then as you inhale, you're going to let the left ear come over toward the left shoulder.
1aJwX9nRlmk_15 Notice again, the right shoulder isn't going to pop up and the left shoulder isn't going to come up to support the ear in your chest.
1aJwX9nRlmk_16 Just keep then gently falling down.
1aJwX9nRlmk_17 So inhale and lift your ear up, and you're going to breathe here.
1aJwX9nRlmk_18 Now, slowly begin to connect these movements, exhaling as you drop the chin toward the chest and inhaling as the ear rolls up towards the shoulder blades, and do this as long as you're comfortable.
1aJwX9nRlmk_19 I'd say at least 20 repetitions.
1aJwX9nRlmk_2 All that's going to happen is you're going to be seated in your easy seated pose, again, with your sits bone on the floor or on a block.
1aJwX9nRlmk_20 If you can keep it going for a minute, that's great, but stick with the breath.
1aJwX9nRlmk_21 Let the breath be the emphasis for every movement and don't ever let yourself give the breath away.
1aJwX9nRlmk_3 You're going to inhale and the crown of the head reaches up so that you're sitting tall, but you're not going to be propped this way.
1aJwX9nRlmk_4 If you're sitting this way, then just relax so that your shoulder blades fall down on either side of the spine, but the crown of your head is still reaching up.
1aJwX9nRlmk_5 You're going to inhale, and then as you exhale, just gently drop the right ear toward the right shoulder.
1aJwX9nRlmk_6 Notice how my shoulders don't creep up--[SOUNDS LIKE] errk--as I drop the ear down, right?
1aJwX9nRlmk_7 They're going to stay exactly where they are and feeling my shoulder blades melting down on either side of the spine, and I'm exhaling to just drop my right ear toward the right shoulder.
1aJwX9nRlmk_8 Take a couple breaths here, inhaling and exhaling, and then, in and out through the nose, remember.
1aJwX9nRlmk_9 And then on an exhale, you're going to go ahead and let the chin fall toward the chest.
1hRI3vPiHjg_0 On this edge weapon attack we're going to look at the hooking attack one more time.
1hRI3vPiHjg_1 This time I want to use a twisting, or a locking type technique.
1hRI3vPiHjg_10 I have to do very little to make that happen.
1hRI3vPiHjg_11 Press down and in, the blade comes out, eject the attacker away.
1hRI3vPiHjg_12 This, remember I'm getting off the line.
1hRI3vPiHjg_13 Don't sit here and do this.
1hRI3vPiHjg_14 I'm here, I'm off the line, making positive contact with the wrist.
1hRI3vPiHjg_15 I'm already really kind of starting this way, so I continue in, arm over, and in I go.
1hRI3vPiHjg_16 Press down, in, pop the knife out, eject the attacker.
1hRI3vPiHjg_17 And that's a good wrist control, from a hooking attack.
1hRI3vPiHjg_2 I want to use the same type of set up I did here.
1hRI3vPiHjg_3 So we come out, I'm just simply going to continue to roll it over, and move in this position here.
1hRI3vPiHjg_4 I'm already moving naturally in that direction to begin with.
1hRI3vPiHjg_5 Here, as my arms come here.
1hRI3vPiHjg_6 All I need to do is step, as I come in here, put my elbow over his, and draw him down and through.
1hRI3vPiHjg_7 His hand is above his elbow, I can cause a great deal of distress, and easily pop the blade out.
1hRI3vPiHjg_8 I'm here, I'm just going to draw him around.
1hRI3vPiHjg_9 And as I do that, my initial, my intertia, my spinning drags him along with me.
204P_kHHWks_0 Now I've been applying product to both eyes and I'm finishing out the top of the left side of her eye.
204P_kHHWks_11 Open, relax and open those eyes.
204P_kHHWks_12 Then I look for even and these are beautifully, evenly done.
204P_kHHWks_13 Then what I would do is get ice packs out and, before I even start the bottoms, just to relieve any kind of swelling and for comfort, I would ice pack her eyes and let her relax and take five minutes while I set up for the step two to the bottom eyes.
279MO2nwC_E_1 In this section we are going to talk about full body movement.
279MO2nwC_E_10 So you really want to make sure that you do that full body movement throughout your whole entire body especially as a cross country runner.
279MO2nwC_E_2 So what I mean by full body movement is from your upper body down to your lower body.
279MO2nwC_E_3 Your upper body you do not want to be timid or shy, I know it is going to feel a little silly if you do not really move your arms, but you should really be moving your arms.
279MO2nwC_E_4 And the reason you will see is that arm movement a lot, especially when the intensity increases, and let's say you come to that hill, you really want to make sure you move your arms because you are now circulating a lot of blood flow evenly throughout your body, and you are getting more oxygen into your lungs, and you are breathing in that fresh air, and blowing it back out with full body movement.
279MO2nwC_E_5 Now as far as your lower body, your legs, you want to make sure that you put most of the weight down your calves.
279MO2nwC_E_6 So you see if I was running, as I am running I am putting most of the weight on my calves and I am moving my body and I am moving my arms and my shoulders.
279MO2nwC_E_7 And breathing in through the nose and breathing out through the mouth.
279MO2nwC_E_8 And will you notice the difference the next time you run, just remember in your mind what I said.
279MO2nwC_E_9 The more that you move your arms, you are going to see yourself increasing in speed and you are going to see the increase in oxygen level compared to just standing there which does very little movement.
28sgR4as6W0_0 Hello.
28sgR4as6W0_1 My name is John Stewart, and this is how to select an area for setting up a tent.
28sgR4as6W0_10 Widow makers are logs, dead trees, anything like that, that could possibly fall on your tent during the night.
28sgR4as6W0_11 These could leave you really, really hurt at night if something like this did happen, so you want to try to avoid all these things.
28sgR4as6W0_12 And lastly, you want to find an area that is near other people.
28sgR4as6W0_13 Near public shelters, and stuff like that just in case of an emergency.
28sgR4as6W0_14 And this is John Stewart on how to select an area for setting up a tent.
28sgR4as6W0_2 The first thing you want to look for when setting up a tent in the area, is you want to look for flat ground.
28sgR4as6W0_3 Flat ground is going to be key to getting a nice solid platform for setting up your tent.
28sgR4as6W0_4 You don't want to find low laying areas where there's holes, valleys, anything like that, because water will pull up if it rains, and it can leak into your tent.
28sgR4as6W0_5 Third thing is you don't want to find real rooted areas.
28sgR4as6W0_6 You don't want to put it in public trails.
28sgR4as6W0_7 You want to find clear areas.
28sgR4as6W0_8 So that you won't have to move later when setting up the tent.
28sgR4as6W0_9 Also you want to look for widow makers.
2Pdxu373jgg_1 I'm from Sweet 16 Studio, and I'm here to talk to you about soundproofing for a recording studio.
2Pdxu373jgg_10 This is a thousand square feet and I have an air conditioner on the roof that can cool four thousand square feet.
2Pdxu373jgg_11 Reason being, it runs much less, it's way more efficient, and it's quieter because I had them install a three speed fan on it, so I can turn that fan way down low and the air just trickles in, you can hardly hear it.
2Pdxu373jgg_12 That way you can keep cool, and record at the same time.
2Pdxu373jgg_13 Okay I'm showing you the air conditioning vents inside the studio now.
2Pdxu373jgg_14 There's eight of them in this particular studio, and I just want to make a point that you don't need to put those air conditioning grates over them.
2Pdxu373jgg_15 It's better to leave those off, and in fact, they cost like thirty bucks each, you can save yourself some bucks there.
2Pdxu373jgg_16 But leave them off so that your air just comes drifting in nice and quietly, and is not obstructed by those grates they normally put on AC units.
2Pdxu373jgg_17 And what I did there was took some foil tape and went around the edge to make it look pretty.
2Pdxu373jgg_18 I don't know, I hope you think it looks pretty, to me it does.
2Pdxu373jgg_2 I'd like to go over a few points about the air conditioning system that I've installed in this studio.
2Pdxu373jgg_3 First of all I've located the air conditioner on the roof, as far away from the studio as possible.
2Pdxu373jgg_4 In fact, it's darn near on the other side of the house.
2Pdxu373jgg_5 I say my house because my house is attached to the other side.
2Pdxu373jgg_6 It's over on the side of the house.
2Pdxu373jgg_7 The pipes come in, the ducts come in to the studio.
2Pdxu373jgg_8 The reason is self explanatory really, you want to keep that sound noise out of your studio.
2Pdxu373jgg_9 Another good point is to, budget permitting, if you can install an air conditioner that is much larger than the one that you'll really need.
2SnVWW3MOB4_1 We are talking about what hairstyles suit a diamond shape face.
2SnVWW3MOB4_2 You want to reduce the width at the sides so you want to go with a bob something short.
2SnVWW3MOB4_3 Probably a little bit shorter then this but something like this would be good.
2SnVWW3MOB4_4 Diamond shape faces need a narrow side and at the chin so if it came down to the chin that would be really good it would complete your look.
2SnVWW3MOB4_5 Avoid wearing height on top or volume on the sides.
2SnVWW3MOB4_6 You can use a bang to cover a narrow forehead or something like this would be really great right about here like this really helps change the shape of the face and give you a better look throughout.
2ri5HYm48MA_0 REBECCA SATO: Hi.
2ri5HYm48MA_10 So what they do is they pick someone for each character that they think kind of embodies that character, someone who realizes that they know but that they don't know too well.
2ri5HYm48MA_11 And what they do is every time they're writing from that character's perspective or about that character, they will think what would that person that I know do, how would they react, how would they sound, how would they look and kind of look at that from that perspective.
2ri5HYm48MA_12 And what's nice is that it's not someone that you know super well and so there's still a lot of room for imagination and creative interpretation which, I think, is very important and we should let it do that.
2ri5HYm48MA_13 So basically, you have this really great base where you know the person enough that you have something to start with but you don't know him so well that it takes away their wonder.
2ri5HYm48MA_14 So try that with your characters and that should really give you something to start with, a really great framework.
2ri5HYm48MA_2 And we're going to talk about character development and how to create really great characters that people are passionate about.
2ri5HYm48MA_3 And it doesn't matter if they love them or they hate them or they love to hate them, preferably a little of everything.
2ri5HYm48MA_4 Not necessarily with the same character, that will be a little conflicted, but with a range of characters that people are having this emotional experience and are able to identify with these people as they read.
2ri5HYm48MA_5 And right now, I'm talking primarily about stories whether it's short stories or novels, but this actually also applies to all kinds of writing even copywriting and advertising and if you're writing a storyboard for a commercial.
2ri5HYm48MA_6 I mean, you still want to know how to develop good characters.
2ri5HYm48MA_7 But primarily, I'll be talking about it from the standpoint of traditional story.
2ri5HYm48MA_8 So one thing that I find to be very helpful and that a lot of really great writers have mentioned--and these are writers who are rich and famous so it's obviously worked for them--is to develop a really great character.
2ri5HYm48MA_9 It helps to have a little bit of information but not too much information.
2yudAtTnZrg_1 Now you put the eggs in before you put your flour mixture in.
2yudAtTnZrg_10 Now this is, you just don't put the whole thing in there you have to gradually put your flour in there.
2yudAtTnZrg_11 Let me repeat you do not want to just throw it in your flour all at once.
2yudAtTnZrg_12 Just gradually do it.
2yudAtTnZrg_13 Maybe a couple of cups at a time.
2yudAtTnZrg_2 Like I said, if you still have a little Crisco and it is floating around it is okay.
2yudAtTnZrg_3 At this time I'm going to add my flour and it takes 6 cups so you need to get.
2yudAtTnZrg_4 It is great if you have one of these really big measuring cups.
2yudAtTnZrg_5 Let me see.
2yudAtTnZrg_6 Let's get the glasses.
2yudAtTnZrg_7 Let me see if I have, I only have 4 in there.
2yudAtTnZrg_8 Let me add some more.
2yudAtTnZrg_9 Okay I have my 6 cups.
30aCkh_hExI_0 Once you've figured out your stance and how to push, the next part is just to enjoy it and ride the board around.
30aCkh_hExI_1 Just aim your front foot forward, just cruise around.
30aCkh_hExI_2 Once you've got pushing regular down you may be able to spin it around and try pushing the other way.
30aCkh_hExI_3 But the important thing that you never want to do is start the cruise pushing around mongo which is pushing with your front foot cause that will totally throw your direction off and send you in all sorts of places you don't want to go.
30aCkh_hExI_4 Because remember as I said in the first series, aiming your front foot is pretty much the determining factor in the direction that you're going to go in.
30aCkh_hExI_5 So when you push mongo like this and aim with your back foot as soon as you aim back on the board you might be able to go in the direction you want to go in but more often than not it will send you somewhere that you don't want to go.
30aCkh_hExI_6 But, well, just cruise around get a feel for your board, feel for the ground before you start trying tricks and from here you can just move forward.
33YRZ5UZTA4_0 JASON PAINTER: Hi, I'm Jason.
33YRZ5UZTA4_1 Today, we're painting on glass.
33YRZ5UZTA4_10 Fill that in, just like that.
33YRZ5UZTA4_11 We don't have to do anything anymore.
33YRZ5UZTA4_12 We'll be defeating the purpose.
33YRZ5UZTA4_13 We'll just spread that paint out thinner and thinner, and just be frustrated in the end.
33YRZ5UZTA4_14 So, this line here is not touching.
33YRZ5UZTA4_15 We can just put a little dab of black there, same as up here.
33YRZ5UZTA4_16 Just, basically, just want everything to touch and that's going to make a big difference when we fill in with the white.
33YRZ5UZTA4_17 So, go ahead and fill in everywhere that you gotta fill in, and look at it, and we'll wait for that to dry.
33YRZ5UZTA4_18 And touch up the white.
33YRZ5UZTA4_2 We have put the first coat, the liner, and the fill in on all three of the steps.
33YRZ5UZTA4_3 It's looking like it's ready now to be--we can really start touching up the liner.
33YRZ5UZTA4_4 We can really start touching up the black.
33YRZ5UZTA4_5 If we look at it, we can see spots that-that filled in and spots that didn't, and we don't have to worry about how these thick line--it really looks bad right now, but we're just in the beginning stages.
33YRZ5UZTA4_6 So, really, those we want to do is make sure that all of the black lines connect, everywhere that we know they're going to need to, and all of the lines are filled in that we know we're going to need to.
33YRZ5UZTA4_7 So, we just take the angle brush back again, get black back out, and really, the less paint you have on here, the better, just a very little on the tip of your brush.
33YRZ5UZTA4_8 This line right here needs to be filled in, and we're not actually going to make any brush strokes.
33YRZ5UZTA4_9 We're just going to set the paint right on it.
33jxeIIbBnM_0 Hi, my name is Dave Andrews.
33jxeIIbBnM_1 Today, I'm going to show you how to run a macro in Excel from Access.
33jxeIIbBnM_10 Click on your office button.
33jxeIIbBnM_11 Go to save as.
33jxeIIbBnM_12 We're going to save macro enable workbook.
33jxeIIbBnM_13 Let's name it book one and just say save.
33jxeIIbBnM_14 Now, we need to go into Access by clicking the start button, all programs, Microsoft Office.
33jxeIIbBnM_15 Let's open Access.
33jxeIIbBnM_16 We need to create a new database by clicking on the office button and saying new.
33jxeIIbBnM_17 Let's leave the name as database one and say create.
33jxeIIbBnM_18 Here's our new database.
33jxeIIbBnM_19 To run that macro from Excel macro from Access, hold down the ALT key on the keyboard.
33jxeIIbBnM_2 Let's begin by opening up Excel.
33jxeIIbBnM_20 Press F11.
33jxeIIbBnM_21 This brings up the visual basic code editor.
33jxeIIbBnM_22 Go to the top.
33jxeIIbBnM_23 Say insert.
33jxeIIbBnM_24 We're going to say module.
33jxeIIbBnM_25 In our code editor, we're going to begin typing in some code.
33jxeIIbBnM_26 Now that we have our function created in Access, I'm going to go over it with you real quick.
33jxeIIbBnM_27 First thing it does is it creates a variable called Excel and the sign says Excel value.
33jxeIIbBnM_28 To the create object function, it launches a new Excel dot application scheme.
33jxeIIbBnM_29 It then opens up a Excel database that we give to it which is the path right here that I typed in and then it simply says Excel dot run and then the name of the macro we created which was macro one.
33jxeIIbBnM_3 Let's first create our macro by clicking the view tab.
33jxeIIbBnM_30 You then could link to this function Excel test within an object in your database.
33jxeIIbBnM_31 My name is Dave Andrews and I just showed you how to run an Excel macro from Access.
33jxeIIbBnM_4 Go into macros and saying record macro.
33jxeIIbBnM_5 We're going to name this macro one just say okay.
33jxeIIbBnM_6 All this macro is going to do is type the number one, two, three, four across the top row.
33jxeIIbBnM_7 So, let's stop record by clicking this little drop down arrow and saying stop record.
33jxeIIbBnM_8 Now, we have our macro created.
33jxeIIbBnM_9 So, let's save this as a macro enable workbook.
36db_jC3ftE_0 Now we're going to string a, put our string around the perimeter and mark the left leach and foot round locations.
36db_jC3ftE_1 So now we're running the string and string always makes a straight line, so its very handy for determining the straight lines and then from the straight line, you can determine the offset to make your curve.
36db_jC3ftE_10 In the case of these day sailing sails, we're using a four point one once cruising slash day sailing cloth from challenge.
36db_jC3ftE_11 So if you look along this edge here, now we two segmented straight lines.
36db_jC3ftE_12 We're kind of approximating the curve.
36db_jC3ftE_13 It?s still just straight, but we have a much better general idea of where the edge of the sail is going to be, and we're not laying out more cloth than we need to.
36db_jC3ftE_14 Here along the foot, again, we're going go about fifty percent.
36db_jC3ftE_15 And where we put this push pen will also determine where we're going to put the foot take up seam.
36db_jC3ftE_16 We're going to go for about five inches of foot round, like I said.
36db_jC3ftE_17 So place the push pen about five inches off the straight line foot.
36db_jC3ftE_18 You have a segmented line, and we will transform this into a curve with the Laughlin pattern.
36db_jC3ftE_2 And I'm going to pull this string pretty tight right here to.
36db_jC3ftE_3 We want to make sure that the string doesn't move as we lay cloth over the top of it.
36db_jC3ftE_4 So there we have our rough sail perimeter.
36db_jC3ftE_5 So again with the push pen, come down about fifty percent and in this case we're going to be three inches of hollow.
36db_jC3ftE_6 In a larger cruising genera, you may want to use up to about nine inches of leach hollow.
36db_jC3ftE_7 The amount of leach hollow you use will also depend on the kind of cloth you're using.
36db_jC3ftE_8 Like I said, more of a racing we're entail.
36db_jC3ftE_9 You can run a lot less leach hollow, because the cloth is so much stiffer.
39FN42e41r0_0 MICHAEL ROSENGART: Right now, I'm here with two personal trainers, Ryan Regensburg and Jonesy and we're doing some renegade rows.
39FN42e41r0_1 So, what I want you to do is go ahead and get into a push up position with two dumbbells in your hands, whereas Ryan's going to show us later on a little variation for it.
39FN42e41r0_10 So, basically, he's just going to work one side at a time.
39FN42e41r0_11 The hand on the ground will give him a little more support and will make it a little easier.
39FN42e41r0_12 And then once he does five, he's just going to switch over to the other side.
39FN42e41r0_13 Again, for this workout, we're working for fifteen to twenty reps and another variation that I want you to work on or consider if you can do it, is a push up renegade row like Jonesy's doing here.
39FN42e41r0_14 Each time you're going down, you're going to do a push up and then come back up.
39FN42e41r0_15 It helps for a couple of different reasons, it helps again, to condition the chest but it also helps to stretch up--stretch out the anterior side of your shoulders which then allows you to get a deeper row.
39FN42e41r0_16 Alright.
39FN42e41r0_17 Good.
39FN42e41r0_18 And then once you've done with fifteen or twenty reps, grab some water, meet us on the next exercise in the next clip.
39FN42e41r0_2 Jonesy's here in a push up position.
39FN42e41r0_3 And what you're going to do is you're going to pull one of the dumbbells up into your rib cage, shifting your weight back and forth.
39FN42e41r0_4 Now, if you're just starting on this, you may want to work with really wide feet.
39FN42e41r0_5 That will give you more balance and support as you perform, alright?
39FN42e41r0_6 At the same time, if you want a little bit more of a challenge, bring your feet closer together as you work.
39FN42e41r0_7 Exhale as you pull up and you're going to feel that you really get to use your abdominals and your obliques as you go back and forth.
39FN42e41r0_8 Ryan, go ahead and get down.
39FN42e41r0_9 And Ryan's going to do a one-handed renegade row.
3EjKvwck6ss_0 Now that we've blow dried and separated all the sub-sections, what we're going to do is go ahead and start with our finishing products.
3EjKvwck6ss_1 What I like to do first is I like to heat the hair up just a little bit, especially just on the ends.
3EjKvwck6ss_10 Does it make the shine stay more?
3EjKvwck6ss_11 It does.
3EjKvwck6ss_12 Basically what I do by heating up the hair, and you'll notice when you put it in, it kind of melts in your hair.
3EjKvwck6ss_13 It's like putting butter.
3EjKvwck6ss_14 When you heat up butter, butter is going to spread better, so basically that's what this is.
3EjKvwck6ss_15 It's like spreading butter.
3EjKvwck6ss_16 Does it help with the dryness?
3EjKvwck6ss_17 It's not going to help with the dryness.
3EjKvwck6ss_18 The moisturizing conditioner is what's going to help with the dryness of your hair.
3EjKvwck6ss_19 What this is going to do is just help to keep its shape, what we're going for.
3EjKvwck6ss_2 We're just going to heat up the hair.
3EjKvwck6ss_20 It's pliable and it's fibrous, and it gives you some of that separation you want on your ends.
3EjKvwck6ss_21 Heat it up in your palms and just pull it through.
3EjKvwck6ss_22 There we go.
3EjKvwck6ss_23 Let's go ahead and go on to our next section.
3EjKvwck6ss_3 Then what I like to do is go on with my fiber pliable paste.
3EjKvwck6ss_4 A lot of people ask me why do you use that product before you go ahead and finalize and finish it.
3EjKvwck6ss_5 I like to think about it as getting your car painted.
3EjKvwck6ss_6 Do you know what they do before they paint your car?
3EjKvwck6ss_7 They prime it.
3EjKvwck6ss_8 Basically what this is doing for me is priming your hair and getting it ready for that last shot of color.
3EjKvwck6ss_9 In this case, hairspray.
3HCjTYIijec_0 Urban legends are often the unwritten beliefs that people have and announce to others.
3HCjTYIijec_1 Well, what are the unwritten rules for women about dating.
3HCjTYIijec_10_11 They're no more successful than you are. The probability is you're more successful They may have their own agenda as well.
3HCjTYIijec_12 So, I would say the first unwritten rule is do not depend on your girl friends to give you valid input for your choices.
3HCjTYIijec_13 That's what it's all about.
3HCjTYIijec_14 This is Dr. Paul.
3HCjTYIijec_15 May your fantasies of today be your realities of tomorrow.
3HCjTYIijec_2 This is Dr. Paul, author of Boomer Girls, a boomer woman's guide to men and dating and host of Ask Dr. Paul.
3HCjTYIijec_3 If they're unwritten, then how do we know them?
3HCjTYIijec_4 Well, they're passed on, and the best thing I can say about unwritten rules is do not depend on another woman, as a woman, to give you valid information.
3HCjTYIijec_5 Guess what, ladies, they're as equally involved with finding the answers as you are, and they're not going to find them from asking you because you're also asking them.
3HCjTYIijec_6 It's a vicious cycle.
3HCjTYIijec_7 If you have questions, as I often say, if you want to find out about a man, why ask a woman, ask a man, ask Dr. Paul.
3HCjTYIijec_8 If you're at the point, where you're asking your girlfriends for their opinions and their input, then you're doing the wrong thing.
3HCjTYIijec_9 So, the unwritten beliefs that you're going to get, that data that you need, from your girl friends, is totally, absolutely, unequivocally wrong.
3QhrOxFdslI_1 This scene is a scene from our most recent production here at Verde Valley Theater called Run for your wife, a British about a cab driver with two wives and two apartments.
3QhrOxFdslI_10 The audience gets more and more involved in this as the scene progresses.
3QhrOxFdslI_11 She's asking the police officer where's her husband and Stanley's standing there and says I'm right here.
3QhrOxFdslI_12 She gets terribly confused and upset.
3QhrOxFdslI_13 It's one of these mistaken identities and trying to cover something up scenes, which gets more and more bizarre as it progresses.
3QhrOxFdslI_14 In fact, Stanley has told the policeman that he was planning in spend the morning in bed with his wife.
3QhrOxFdslI_15 The policeman is quite surprised by how she's acting toward him and it ends up with her screaming and he kind of mimicking her as though this was a little foreplay game that they play and he runs out of the apartment.
3QhrOxFdslI_16 A couple of occasions, this kind of brought the audience to their feet applauding at the end of this scene.
3QhrOxFdslI_17 Some very, very talented actors and an extremely well written scene combined to make for a really good part of the show here.
3QhrOxFdslI_2 In this scene, a police officer is checking up on some reports of a missing person.
3QhrOxFdslI_3 The cab driver's friend Stanley, the upstairs neighbor is trying to convince the police officer that he is John Smith, that he is the cab driver.
3QhrOxFdslI_4 John's wife Mary is in the scene.
3QhrOxFdslI_5 She walks into the scene after the scene begins between the police officer and Stanley, so Stanley needs to act the part of Mary's husband.
3QhrOxFdslI_6 Of course, he's not her husband.
3QhrOxFdslI_7 He's the upstairs neighbor, whom she finds extremely annoying.
3QhrOxFdslI_8 He's always pestering them and borrowing money and so on.
3QhrOxFdslI_9 Suddenly he's trying to show affection to her and this upsets her tremendously.
3TrMyzNWGpY_0 Hi everybody I'm John Graden from the Martial Arts Teacher's Association and johngraden.com.
3TrMyzNWGpY_1 How do you practice your kickboxing moves?
3TrMyzNWGpY_10 Every time you throw your reverse move you always close the gap on your opponent, come in, engage, and then clear step out, re-open the gap with a clearing technique, I like to clear with a jab or I'll clear with the front leg round kick.
3TrMyzNWGpY_11 So I engage, step in, fire, fire, fire, clear and then here is the biggy, change my alignment on the bag or the target and then repeat the process.
3TrMyzNWGpY_12 So we are mixing our snapping techniques not just doing power all the time, two, every attack penetrating footwork, engage, clearing footwork, change your alignment that's always the pattern.
3TrMyzNWGpY_13 Penetrate, engage, clear, change your alignment, penetrate, engage, clear, change your alignment.
3TrMyzNWGpY_14 Make sure that that is the pattern you are developing in the gym so that when you are in the ring that is how your fight comes out.
3TrMyzNWGpY_15 I'm John Graden.
3TrMyzNWGpY_16 I hope that helps.
3TrMyzNWGpY_17 Thanks very much.
3TrMyzNWGpY_2 That's a great question.
3TrMyzNWGpY_3 As a kickboxer this is one I'm particularly fond of.
3TrMyzNWGpY_4 Here is a common mistake that people make when they are dong their kickboxing moves.
3TrMyzNWGpY_5 If I am hitting the bag or I'm doing the targets most beginners will try and power every single move.
3TrMyzNWGpY_6 They'll try and slam the bag every move and what happens when you do that is one, you waste a lot of energy, two, you tense the body up, three you tend to run out of gas faster.
3TrMyzNWGpY_7 You don't typically spar like that or fight like that in a match so you want to train like you fight in a match and how is that?
3TrMyzNWGpY_8 I'll have techniques that I'm just going to snap and I'm just going to pop out there so I might go snap, snap, snap, snap, snap and about every seventh or eight go pow, pow, pow, pow, pow and then I recover.
3TrMyzNWGpY_9 Pow, pow, pow, pow so I'm mixing my snapping my speed techniques with my power techniques, two, every time you step in and every time you throw a technique you want to make sure you're penetrating with your footwork and you are not standing in one spot digging a hole.
3_15epaELCs_0 Okay so we're throwing a platter here, a large plate.
3_15epaELCs_1 And the first thing we're going to want to do is center the clay before we start to throw.
3_15epaELCs_10 I'm just going to use these two parts of my hand to push the clay up.
3_15epaELCs_11 And I'm going to push it back down.
3_15epaELCs_12 It's important to note that I'm not simply drawing the clay from the outside and pulling it up around the edges, I'm actually squeezing the clay up into itself.
3_15epaELCs_13 Whereby centering the entire piece of clay.
3_15epaELCs_14 If you have some clay at the bottom there which is throwing you off, you can see how that's not on center.
3_15epaELCs_15 Simply take a rib tool, and take that off of there.
3_15epaELCs_16 I'm going to do this a few more times to demonstrate, squeezing the clay up.
3_15epaELCs_17 And pushing it back down.
3_15epaELCs_18 I may be making it look easy here, and it will be frustrating if you're just starting out and just sitting down and beginning to throw.
3_15epaELCs_19 But you really have to do this over and over again.
3_15epaELCs_2 What I like to do first is get the clay nice and wet.
3_15epaELCs_20 And after a while you'll get the hang of it.
3_15epaELCs_21 So don't be intimidated if it doesn't work out the first time, it doesn't work out the first time for anyone.
3_15epaELCs_22 So we have it pretty nicely centered up.
3_15epaELCs_23 The difference between centering clay for a pot and centering clay for something like a platter is we're actually going to make it, we going to center up our form and make it much wider than we normally would.
3_15epaELCs_24 Just pushing it down onto the wheel, centering our form, like so.
3_15epaELCs_25 And just square it up a little bit, take some excess off the edge, like so.
3_15epaELCs_26 So now we have a centered piece of clay on the bat, and the next thing we're going to do is enter the form and pull out the walls of this platter.
3_15epaELCs_27 And we'll be doing that in the next part of this lesson.
3_15epaELCs_3 And the first thing I like to do is push the clay down onto the wheel to make sure it's stuck, like so.
3_15epaELCs_4 Just pushing down on the clay to make sure it's nicely stuck on to the bat.
3_15epaELCs_5 Okay now centering is a process of squeezing the clay up through your hands and pushing it back down, and as you push it back down you're forcing the clay onto the center of the wheel.
3_15epaELCs_6 I'm going to use this part of my hand to force it into center.
3_15epaELCs_7 And I'm going to lock that into a part of my body, into my gut here, so that I have nice control.
3_15epaELCs_8 I'm going to use this part of my hand to push the clay back down and push it onto the surface.
3_15epaELCs_9 Okay so first we're going to bring it up.
3hqV8qx75YE_0 One of the most important things about drawing, or coming up with ideas, is having a sketch book.
3hqV8qx75YE_1 And that's a place where you can draw whatever it is that you want.
3hqV8qx75YE_10 I did an actual study of this and sometimes I'm just messing around, doing whatever I feel like and I have beautiful art like this, that's quality.
3hqV8qx75YE_11 You know I can put that in my sketch book and nobody's going to judge me in the art world, because it's my sketch book and I can put what I want in it.
3hqV8qx75YE_12 So, first you have to get a sketch book, then you have to scribble all over it, so that there's nothing that's keeping you, nothing that's blocking you from letting out whatever idea it is, that's inside you, that you want to get out on paper.
3hqV8qx75YE_13 And you have to be able to be comfortable scribbling in a sketch book, before you're going to be comfortable drawing on an actual drawing, that is on an expensive piece of paper that means something to you, if it's going to be a piece of art in the end.
3hqV8qx75YE_2 And you don't have to worry about whether or not it looks good.
3hqV8qx75YE_3 A sketch book isn't a place that you keep all of your best drawings or even any good drawings.
3hqV8qx75YE_4 It's just where you doodle ideas you just kind of let your pen flow.
3hqV8qx75YE_5 You don't have to worry about.
3hqV8qx75YE_6 It's like your personal diary.
3hqV8qx75YE_7 So, I just want to flip through, this is my actual sketch book.
3hqV8qx75YE_8 I have some studies in here, and like some of it looks good and some of it looks unfinished.
3hqV8qx75YE_9 I mean a lot of it doesn't make any sense.
3sZjSNcqXpI_1 Now depending on your style of play, if you like to play offense or defense you should be able to choose before you start the game where you want to go on the field.
3sZjSNcqXpI_2 If you're willing to play defense you should stay in the back where you can see the field clearly and be able to communicate with your teammates who move forward.
3sZjSNcqXpI_3 Now if defense isn't your thing and you like to play more offense, when you're playing up front be sure that you communicate with your teammate who is playing defense.
3sZjSNcqXpI_4 Ask them where the teammates of the other team are so you can be able to, be able not get shot at from an area where you're not looking.
3sZjSNcqXpI_5 If you're playing offense and you're up front, make sure you're laying down as much fire as possible to keep the other team from not shooting at you.
3uIuLtqdmqU_0 Ok now I want to make a kind of a Santa Fe style pot.
3uIuLtqdmqU_1 Those are the ones that like they come out the bottom and they come in like that; usually there hand built, coil built and then after they set up you take a stone to it and you varnish it up real nice and you make it; make it real shiny.
3uIuLtqdmqU_2 So we're going to start by not coil building it because I got this wheel here and you want to start by thinning your clay, alright.
3uIuLtqdmqU_3 Pull it up; pull it all the way up like it's a stalagmite growing from your wheel head, you can even go bigger if you want; alright.
3uIuLtqdmqU_4 Then you want to come down; lock your hands, lock your legs; lock your arms and your legs and power down on it and all the while you're wheel wedging and you're centering your piece of clay.
3uIuLtqdmqU_5 Come down and Karate chop it with your hand, just like that; alright.
3uIuLtqdmqU_6 And when you're throwing pots it's kind of a little bit more important to make sure that it's nice and centered; from little stuff it's, it's alright to throw off center but if you're going to throw a pot it's going to really be a pain if it's not centered correctly.
3uIuLtqdmqU_7 And there it is; it's centered.
3wVrsesGaI4_0 In this clip we're talking about the holidays and how we're defining the lines and the techniques that we're using.
3wVrsesGaI4_1 And as you can see, I'm dipping each time.
3wVrsesGaI4_10 And you see that defined it, and it tightened up the edges.
3wVrsesGaI4_11 We're going to do the same thing over here on this side.
3wVrsesGaI4_12 This is using a seven Mag to tighten up the edges of the lines, which is fine in cases like this.
3wVrsesGaI4_13 And we're just going to continue on.
3wVrsesGaI4_2 I'm using some petroleum jelly and working an area.
3wVrsesGaI4_3 I've worked some of this area up top.
3wVrsesGaI4_4 And you can see how I've tightened these lines up.
3wVrsesGaI4_5 And here's an example what I'm going to do.
3wVrsesGaI4_6 On this curved line right here, as you can see in this segmented line, I'm going to take the seven Mag, work at an angle.
3wVrsesGaI4_7 Stretch the area, and define the line by moving down.
3wVrsesGaI4_8 And while I'm down there, I can define this line by moving up in small skating motions.
3wVrsesGaI4_9 And then complete the top part of this.
3xni-I6N3EY_1 This medicine has been around for over 5,000 years.
3xni-I6N3EY_2 Before recorded history, between 100 BC and 200 AD The Yellow Emperor's Classic was written down so there was a huge amount of time when medicine was being practiced upon in the China continent and its fundamental principles all came back to the philosophies that were also moving across.
3xni-I6N3EY_3 You had observation as the key point.
3xni-I6N3EY_4 It was sacrilegious to dissect the human body so the systems of acupuncture, acupressure, as well as the use of herbs all came about through trial and error and they all came about through the constellations of the stars and the idea reflected of the micro and the macro so that points were developed for the purpose of releasing this natural flow of Chi.
3xni-I6N3EY_5 In this next segment we will talk about the six external causes of illness.
40JRPcYZkWg_1 If you look out on the market, you're going to find a lot of different types of equipment.
40JRPcYZkWg_2 The two big ones, I want to talk about though right now, are metal versus plastic.
40JRPcYZkWg_3 If you remember, to make good biodiesel we need a lot of heat.
40JRPcYZkWg_4 Typically, if you find metal processors, you're going to get better reaction simply because the heat is better.
40JRPcYZkWg_5 You also want to look for good mixing as well.
40JRPcYZkWg_6 Also, because we are dealing with a flammable substance, methanol, it's a little bit safer if you use metal tanks versus plastic tanks.
40JRPcYZkWg_7 Also, if you're heating within the tank, you don't want your tank to melt on you, so I kinda recommend metal tanks over plastic tanks.
40JRPcYZkWg_8 Do your research, look hard but look for the plastic, look for the metal, see which ones work the best for you.
40JRPcYZkWg_9 Again, calling it referrals, but my feeling is you can make better biodiesel with metal tanks.
43X_QWkIxxg_0 EMIL LAMPRECHT: Now, I've taught you Under the Leg in the past series but I'm going to go over it again, discussing more the structure of learning Body Throws in preparation for learning things like Backcrosses, Over the Shoulders, and Penguin Catches.
43X_QWkIxxg_1 Now, as I talked about in the last clip, you need to practice getting the trick down one at a time, and it's very important to keep good posture, good head position, and not be scrambling all over the place to make your catch.
43X_QWkIxxg_2 Now, always start with one object and, for Under the Leg, always remember to bring your leg up to you.
43X_QWkIxxg_3 If you start to lean towards your leg, your tendency will be to either to throw out or you won't be able to see what's coming down so you can catch it.
43X_QWkIxxg_4 If you bring your leg up to you, it takes more energy from the waist down, but you can work your agility and then it will also make it, the throw and the catch, much easier.
43X_QWkIxxg_5 When learning to put 'em all together with any Body Throw, you want to have a structured practice.
43X_QWkIxxg_6 Short controlled runs, as I've mentioned before, are very important, but also the pattern in which you throw them...every third throw, Juggler's Tennis, maybe every third throw alternating.
43X_QWkIxxg_7 You can mix up the pattern but it's important to get it down.
43X_QWkIxxg_8 You may also want to practice your balance with Under the Leg by just doing it constantly on one side.
43X_QWkIxxg_9 This is a whole different trick but it may help with some things.
46Cwjrd4ua4_0 Now the next environmental factors that you want to look at are the date, and the year.
46Cwjrd4ua4_1 When does this take place?
46Cwjrd4ua4_10 Is it taking place in the summer?
46Cwjrd4ua4_11 The fall?
46Cwjrd4ua4_12 The spring?
46Cwjrd4ua4_13 These are real important things, because let's say it's taking place in New Orleans in the summer.
46Cwjrd4ua4_14 Well, that means it's going to be hot and muggy, and that's going to directly affect how your character's going to respond.
46Cwjrd4ua4_15 Or is it taking place in North Dakota in the winter, where it's very, very cold?
46Cwjrd4ua4_16 That will affect how your character reacts and responds and moves, and so forth and so on.
46Cwjrd4ua4_17 You also need to take a look at the time period, in the sense of how long does this whole interaction of this play or movie take place?
46Cwjrd4ua4_18 Is it a day?
46Cwjrd4ua4_19 Is it a week?
46Cwjrd4ua4_2 Is it 1912?
46Cwjrd4ua4_20 Is it a month?
46Cwjrd4ua4_21 Is it a year?
46Cwjrd4ua4_22 Does everything usually take place in the morning, or in the middle of the night, or in the daytime?
46Cwjrd4ua4_23 All of those things can affect how your character acts.
46Cwjrd4ua4_24 Also, you also want to take into consideration the date.
46Cwjrd4ua4_25 Meaning, are there any specific holidays?
46Cwjrd4ua4_26 Does this take place on a Sunday?
46Cwjrd4ua4_27 What do people usually do on Sunday?
46Cwjrd4ua4_28 Does it take place on a Monday?
46Cwjrd4ua4_29 What are people usually doing on a Monday?
46Cwjrd4ua4_3 Is it 1960's?
46Cwjrd4ua4_30 Does it take place over St. Patrick's Day, or President's Day, or Christmas?
46Cwjrd4ua4_31 Take into effect all of those environmental factors.
46Cwjrd4ua4_4 Is it 2008?
46Cwjrd4ua4_5 Is it in the future?
46Cwjrd4ua4_6 Going to be real important to know what time period, because people acted differently; the social norms were different, in different time periods.
46Cwjrd4ua4_7 You also want to take a look at the season.
46Cwjrd4ua4_8 What time of year does this take place?
46Cwjrd4ua4_9 And it could change, throughout the play or the movie, but is it taking place in the winter?
48Hj_AyP3Fk_0 Hello.
48Hj_AyP3Fk_1 My name is Zephyr Clarke-Dolberg from Miami Dog Training.
48Hj_AyP3Fk_10 So I'm going to ex, ex, show you an example of that right now.
48Hj_AyP3Fk_11 You notice she stays behind me.
48Hj_AyP3Fk_12 She's not advancing forward because she needs to read my body language to see what she should do next.
48Hj_AyP3Fk_13 She should be always looking for a cue from you.
48Hj_AyP3Fk_14 So, and as you can see when I stop she sits and she's relaxed.
48Hj_AyP3Fk_15 So, when you're walking your dog you always want to stay controlled.
48Hj_AyP3Fk_16 And always walk them on one side so they're not confused about going back and forth.
48Hj_AyP3Fk_17 This is Zephyr Clarke-Dolberg and this has been how to walk a dog.
48Hj_AyP3Fk_2 In this clip we're going to teach you how to walk a dog.
48Hj_AyP3Fk_3 Now number one is with the leash.
48Hj_AyP3Fk_4 Sometimes, you know, people get confident, over confident with their dogs off leash and, you know, something spooks a dog, it sees a cat, it runs out into the street and that can cause problems.
48Hj_AyP3Fk_5 So walking a dog number one should be done on the leash.
48Hj_AyP3Fk_6 Preferably a five to six foot leash.
48Hj_AyP3Fk_7 I prefer a five foot leash.
48Hj_AyP3Fk_8 And a leather leash, you know, your tools are, are your biggest asset when you're working with your dog or walking with your dog.
48Hj_AyP3Fk_9 So, walking with your dog, you always want to make sure that you are the leader you're in the front.
48hXSSOwsNE_0_1 On this segment we're going to talk about foot brush sets, and combinations. It's very important when you're setting your foot brushes to put it in the right spot.
48hXSSOwsNE_2 It makes it a lot easier to, to complete the move.
48hXSSOwsNE_3 So you really want your, your foot brushes to be right in front of you, so when you go to set it up and kick it, it's going to be right in your wheelhouse.
48hXSSOwsNE_4 So now the wind has changed directions a little bit, so we're going to maybe go here.
48hXSSOwsNE_5 So I'm going to toss it to Ryan; he's going to set it up for a foot brush for me.
48hXSSOwsNE_6 And if you notice, it was right in the perfect spot, right here, off of his set to my foot brush.
48hXSSOwsNE_7 Now, if you want to do several different combinations where you're putting a couple of the foot brushes together, you could toss it up, kick it here, toss it up, here, here, here.
48hXSSOwsNE_8 So you can do tons of different combos.
48hXSSOwsNE_9 You can actually go there, left foot and right foot.
4CSSlWonj3E_0 RICHARD BUCCOLA: Hi.
4CSSlWonj3E_2 All right, we put our garlic in a bowl and now, we're going to just cut up some celery as well.
4CSSlWonj3E_3 I'm just going to cut off the top end of that celery and what I want to do is just give it a good slice lengthwise and maybe another time lengthwise, that's pretty good, just them out them together and just start to cut tiny little pieces.
4CSSlWonj3E_4 I'm cutting these down, I'm going to cut all the way through.
4CSSlWonj3E_5 We only need about a quarter cup of celery, but I like to chop these down even finer.
4CSSlWonj3E_6 So what I'll do is then start again doing my chopping motion of my blade, coming--the back of the blade coming up and down.
4CSSlWonj3E_7 All right, I got these chopped real fine the way I want it so I'm just going to add it to my bowl and I'm going to then chop up our zucchini.
4CSSlWonj3E_8 We're just trying to chop up everything so it's all prepped; this is all our prep work right now.
4CSSlWonj3E_9 So come on back.
4GG2H4QR9W8_0 How you doing?
4GG2H4QR9W8_10 If you see any browning or it is kind of hard that means that it is a older lime and you don't want to go around that lime you want it to stay away from that.
4GG2H4QR9W8_11 With your Serrano's you also want them to be bright green and just look around and make sure that there is no holes or bruising.
4GG2H4QR9W8_12 You onions are kind of hard to tell what your onions look likes because it has a wrap around it you just want to go around the onion and kind of feel and make sure there is no holes or anything like that and the same thing with the shallots.
4GG2H4QR9W8_13 You want to go around and make sure there is no holes and that is how you can pick ingredient for making this meal.
4GG2H4QR9W8_2 The first thing on this I'm going to do is show you how to pick out ingredients.
4GG2H4QR9W8_3 First of all you have the tomato, the tomato needs to be nice and firm all the way around.
4GG2H4QR9W8_4 You want there to be no bruising or no big dents and you want it to be bright red.
4GG2H4QR9W8_5 The avocado for the guacamole now you want this avocado to be nice and tender.
4GG2H4QR9W8_6 You don't want it to be real hard or anything like that, you want to be able to push this circle button on the very top to push that button in and if sinks in like that then that it is nice and firm in the inside.
4GG2H4QR9W8_7 You got your mango we want to make sure that your mango is pretty tender so if you push it down you can go in but you don't want it to be so soft where you thumb goes right through.
4GG2H4QR9W8_8 You want it to be kind of firm but at the same time you want it to be also tender.
4GG2H4QR9W8_9 Same thing with your lime you want to see a nice tenderness going all the way around it and you want it to be bright green.
4PKquZ1fUGk_0 The first product that I'm going to talk to about is a product called Egyptian Magic.
4PKquZ1fUGk_1 This is one of my favorite things to use for hair, skin, lips, soars, everything.
4PKquZ1fUGk_10 Just to get that scalp extra happy and extra moisturized.
4PKquZ1fUGk_11 Since it's just been pulled on for an extended amount of time.
4PKquZ1fUGk_2 It's great.
4PKquZ1fUGk_3 Now when it comes to this product, the best quality about it is that it's all natural ingredients.
4PKquZ1fUGk_4 As you can see, it kind of starts out looking like a wax, but when you dig some out, you just stick it in your hand and then it melts slowly and turns into oil.
4PKquZ1fUGk_5_6 This makes it really easy to massage into a scalp and to run through somebodies hair. This, I really like to use in pretreatment.
4PKquZ1fUGk_7 If you rub a lot of this throughout the hair, it's kind of like a leave in conditioner and it keeps it moisturized throughout the whole braiding process.
4PKquZ1fUGk_8 That way it doesn't dry out anytime in the middle, but it's great for your skin.
4PKquZ1fUGk_9 Also, after braiding style is complete, it's good to just take a little bit and run it in between each braid.
4VXvnpxTEEw_0 In this next clip we're going to talk about wind chill and wind chill factors.
4VXvnpxTEEw_1 This is a critical consideration when you're dealing with the outdoors.
4VXvnpxTEEw_10 This wind chill chart is available from the NOA weather and the National Weather Service as a free download from their website.
4VXvnpxTEEw_2 The wind chill and your dress.
4VXvnpxTEEw_3 You dress for wind chill, not for the temperature that you have outside.
4VXvnpxTEEw_4 For instance right here, since we been filming here for this clip, a cloud came over and the temperature dropped ten degrees just in the last two minutes.
4VXvnpxTEEw_5 And the wind chill actually adds extra to that temperature drop.
4VXvnpxTEEw_6 So wind chill, we'll take a look at this wind chill chart and I'll show you what kind of temperature drops you have even for a minor change in the wind.
4VXvnpxTEEw_7 On this wind chill chart you have the temperature across the top, and then you have the wind speed along the sides.
4VXvnpxTEEw_8 And then you just cross reference your data and you'll come up with the actual real temperature, real life temperature that you have to dress for.
4VXvnpxTEEw_9 A five degree shift in the wind will drop the actual real life temperature ten to fifteen degrees.
4VdzmWyNsxY_0 In this clip, we'll talk about different types of breast implants.
4VdzmWyNsxY_1 There are two essential types, different types of implants.
4VdzmWyNsxY_2 One implant is filled with a silicon gel, and the other implant is filled with salt water or saline.
4VdzmWyNsxY_3 Traditionally, the silicon gel implants have been the preference of most plastic surgeons because of the qualities of the gel and that there is a better cohesiveness and softness, possibly less rippling and a more natural feel to the implant.
4VdzmWyNsxY_4 What happened was, in 1992, the silicon gel implants were taken off the market because there was concern that the silicon gel would potentially leak out of the implant and then cause diseases in the body.
4VdzmWyNsxY_5 Sixteen years later, just a few years ago, it was decided to allow them to be released back onto the market again with certain restrictions, in that people would have to make sure to follow certain guidelines, as with being only over a twenty-two to have silicon gel-filled implants, and then having an MRI, which is a special type of X-Ray done later in the future to make sure that there was no problem with the implant.
4VdzmWyNsxY_6 And this after, of course, all the evidence, weight of evidence showed that it was very unlikely that there were serious systemic effects from the silicon breast implants.
4XgOVMG-zIo_0 I'm going to show you how to make a Bluebird.
4XgOVMG-zIo_1 Now this drink is stirred and not shaken so you don't need much ice.
4XgOVMG-zIo_10 Despite it's blue flavor, it has an orange taste behind it.
4XgOVMG-zIo_11 Then you're going to add a couple dashes of bitters so have that handy.
4XgOVMG-zIo_12 Do just a couple.
4XgOVMG-zIo_13 That should be good.
4XgOVMG-zIo_14 And then you're going to stir it so have your stirrer available.
4XgOVMG-zIo_15 Put it in and twist it around just like that.
4XgOVMG-zIo_16 Looks good.
4XgOVMG-zIo_17 Then you're going to strain it in to a glass.
4XgOVMG-zIo_18 So, grab your glass, have your stainer available and gently pout it in.
4XgOVMG-zIo_19 Just like so.
4XgOVMG-zIo_2 So take it put it in to your glass.
4XgOVMG-zIo_20 And you're going to garnish this with a cherry and a lemon twist, that you can twist.
4XgOVMG-zIo_21 Pour in just like that, put in your straw and then you have a Blue Bird.
4XgOVMG-zIo_3 You're going to add an ounce and half of gin.
4XgOVMG-zIo_4 So get your jigger.
4XgOVMG-zIo_5 Pour in an ounce, flip it over and add the half of ounce.
4XgOVMG-zIo_6 Then you're going to add an ounce of trip sec, actually half an ounce of triple sec.
4XgOVMG-zIo_7 Just grab that.
4XgOVMG-zIo_8 To the small side of the jigger.
4XgOVMG-zIo_9 You're going to do an half an ounce of blue Curacao.
4XlVMRXLydg_0 We're going to do gathering chi from heaven and earth.
4XlVMRXLydg_1 And I want you to, if you'd like to follow along with me, that'd be great.
4XlVMRXLydg_10 There are so many movements in Qigung that, when you learn a great amount of Qigung, you could pick what you would like to do, what your body can handle.
4XlVMRXLydg_11 OK?
4XlVMRXLydg_12 And, a real simple one is gathering chi from heaven and earth.
4XlVMRXLydg_13 And what I'd like to do is demonstrate the form for you and kind of just talk through the form as you're watching me do this.
4XlVMRXLydg_14 So, we always want to start out in the Wu Chi posture.
4XlVMRXLydg_15 Right -- first one, always stand in the Wu Chi posture.
4XlVMRXLydg_16 Work your way from the feet up to the top of the head.
4XlVMRXLydg_17 Once you do that, then you go to your breathing.
4XlVMRXLydg_18 Inhale, exhale.
4XlVMRXLydg_19 OK?
4XlVMRXLydg_2 But gathering chi from heaven and earth, one of the great things about Qigung is that the movements can be very, very simple.
4XlVMRXLydg_20 From here, once you have a feeling of peace and focus, that the mind isn't racing around anymore, that you're very calm and relaxed, let's begin the movement then.
4XlVMRXLydg_21 Then begin the posture and the movement is what we're going to do, which is gathering chi from heaven and earth.
4XlVMRXLydg_3 We don't have to do any complex movements here.
4XlVMRXLydg_4 There are complex movements later on in higher levels of Qigung.
4XlVMRXLydg_5 But the wonderful thing about Qigung is that Quigung can be done with any age group.
4XlVMRXLydg_6 Any age group.
4XlVMRXLydg_7 We have movements in Qigung that eighty year olds can do, ninety year olds can do.
4XlVMRXLydg_8 We have movements in Quigung that require stronger flexibility, more endurance and so on.
4XlVMRXLydg_9 But the point to this is that when you do Qigung, you can do so many different movements.
58jqBSopR3s_0 OK, when you talk about color you can't forget the neutrals.
58jqBSopR3s_1 That is, you know, there are times when you need grays, there are times when you need colors that just aren't colors, and obviously, as soon as you say gray you think, black and white make gray.
58jqBSopR3s_10 And the answer to that is actually to try to use all the colors, in a way, with out getting too mushed up.
58jqBSopR3s_11 So I've got my purple, or violet, and I'm going to, I know that has red and blue in it.
58jqBSopR3s_12 So, I've got my yellow and I'm going to add some yellow to it, and I'm going to to stick with the darker yellow for now so that I don't get too messed up here.
58jqBSopR3s_13 And we still have a, a dull purple.
58jqBSopR3s_14 You know, this is really, this qualifies as the dull purple.
58jqBSopR3s_2 And indeed here is a classic value scale.
58jqBSopR3s_3 There's black paint at the bottom, white paint at the top, and these I try to get sort of even increments of grays between light and dark.
58jqBSopR3s_4 The average value scale is generally like between nine and twelve steps.
58jqBSopR3s_5 It's sort of like a scale.
58jqBSopR3s_6 So, this is a scale of black to white.
58jqBSopR3s_7 Now, in color, you know, the gray is obviously, doesn't seem to have any color, and neutral really does mean when you can't really make up your mind what the color is.
58jqBSopR3s_8 And we played with that a little bit in saturation, and we're going to play with it just a little bit more and do some adjusting.
58jqBSopR3s_9 So, I'm going to go back here in my yellow and violet range and see if I can get something that is, you know, how gray, you know, how close to a a gray can I get with out really, with out using black and white.
5BFff-4A_aA_0 So we've been working on directional rolling and, as we've discussed, we're working on five degree incrementals.
5BFff-4A_aA_1 Well, as five degree incrementals increase, you can't roll down the long part of your body any more.
5BFff-4A_aA_10 Okay?
5BFff-4A_aA_11 Now, the leg is going to go back but it's only going to go to the other leg.
5BFff-4A_aA_12 Or, you can also stretch it out.
5BFff-4A_aA_13 I prefer to stretch it out, it gets me closer to the ground faster.
5BFff-4A_aA_14 So, what happens is, you're going to stretch it out, lean into it, go ahead and touch the floor.
5BFff-4A_aA_15 You're going to use a slight kickoff with this leg to give yourself some projection into the side direction.
5BFff-4A_aA_16 Number zero, 90 degrees.
5BFff-4A_aA_17 I should be able to see you the whole time.
5BFff-4A_aA_18 So, its across the back and it's across the shoulders, but you're, instead of going across your body, you're having to go across your wingspan and your shoulder blades.
5BFff-4A_aA_2 You have to start changing the angle as the angle increases.
5BFff-4A_aA_3 So, and the closer you get to 90 degrees, the more you have to be going across your shoulders.
5BFff-4A_aA_4 So, as it approaches 90 degrees, regardless, because it's essentially a forward roll until you hit 90 degrees,.
5BFff-4A_aA_5 You're just getting used to the idea of falling from an aspect that you're not used to.
5BFff-4A_aA_6 So, if this is my zero line and that's my 90 degrees, at 45, you're still essentially doing a forward roll but there's more on the shoulder.
5BFff-4A_aA_7 As it, and as I said, as it approaches 90, you're moving more across the shoulders.
5BFff-4A_aA_8 So, how do we do this without killing ourselves?
5BFff-4A_aA_9 You start it the same way we started the break fall or the beginnings of break fall, in which the leg goes back.
5Gw0TpbCMTQ_0 Hi, my name's Floyd, I'm talking to you today from theacousticmusician.com in Sandy, Utah, and we're going to talk about how to read guitar music today.
5Gw0TpbCMTQ_1 The most common form of guitar music that is used nowadays is called tablature.
5Gw0TpbCMTQ_2 And that is this line here, and what it is is each one of the lines here represents the strings on the guitar.
5Gw0TpbCMTQ_3 This would be your high E, this would be your low E, and this shows which fret or the position on the guitar that you would play.
5Gw0TpbCMTQ_4 Now the line up here is standard notation which a lot of people don't know how to read.
5Gw0TpbCMTQ_5 But this just shows finger position and note placement on the strings to be able to play the guitar.
5RR7dlzkyL0_0 Now first of all, I want to tell you, when you are doing business over the phone, you automatically lose a huge part of your ability to communicate.
5RR7dlzkyL0_1 And what I'm talking about is, no longer do you have any non-verbal’s to work with.
5RR7dlzkyL0_2 Whoever's on the other end of that phone, they can't see your face, they can't see your body, they can't read what you're doing or what's in your environment.
5RR7dlzkyL0_3 So basically all you're left with is your tone of voice.
5RR7dlzkyL0_4 Your attitude, which comes through in your tone of voice, and this is what you have to work with.
5RR7dlzkyL0_5 This is what will convey your professionalism.
5RR7dlzkyL0_6 This is what will convey your willingness to listen, and to help, and to be a professional.
5RR7dlzkyL0_7 So it's very important that we focus on the specifics of working with such few things.
5iyYqy4gqEI_0 Hi!
5iyYqy4gqEI_10 It comes in the silver and the gold, so you can choose whatever color you would like for your project.
5iyYqy4gqEI_11 You can also get it at the hardware store in black color.
5iyYqy4gqEI_12 This is a dull black color.
5iyYqy4gqEI_13 This is a 24 gage, but it's black if you would like that color.
5iyYqy4gqEI_14 Sometimes on the internet, you can find different colors.
5iyYqy4gqEI_15 I've used black, red, and pink.
5iyYqy4gqEI_16 For this project, a red or a green would be cute.
5iyYqy4gqEI_17 We're just going to use the silver today.
5iyYqy4gqEI_2 I'd like to tell you about the wire that I use.
5iyYqy4gqEI_3 The wire for the bracelets right here are this 24 gage wire.
5iyYqy4gqEI_4 It comes in a spool of 25 yards, and I just buy it at Wal-Mart.
5iyYqy4gqEI_5 This is the 24 gage.
5iyYqy4gqEI_6 You can use 26 gage, 28 gage.
5iyYqy4gqEI_7 They are thinner and easier to crochet.
5iyYqy4gqEI_8 22 gage, 20 gage is really stiff and it's really hard to crochet.
5iyYqy4gqEI_9 Some of it you can't even crochet.
BIUNqI3uCMw_0 One of the most common faults in wheel thrown pottery, is an S crack.
BIUNqI3uCMw_1 And this is a typical shallow S crack, which can form either in the drying stage, when the piece reaches the bone dry stage, or it can be noticed in the bisque firing stage or in the glaze firing stage.
BIUNqI3uCMw_2 And it occurs from the clay platelets not being aligned correctly.
BIUNqI3uCMw_3 It's essentially at fault caused by improper technique on throwing on the wheel.
BIUNqI3uCMw_4 It can be easily alleviated and certain clay bodies are more forgiving of improper technique than others.
BIUNqI3uCMw_5 Certain clay bodies are not as forgiving.
BIUNqI3uCMw_6 But it comes down to handling the clay correctly on the wheel and performing the proper wedging procedures before it gets to the wheel.
BIUNqI3uCMw_7 And what that will do is align all the clay platelets in the correct direction and they'll be stable on drying.
BL4ZqiUZO1U_1 Minimum 1x3 counter battens are run vertical and centered over existing rafters.
BL4ZqiUZO1U_2 A moisture membrane of felt Tri Flex or ice and water shield is placed horizontally with proper lap to allow the membrane to loop over the counter battens.
BL4ZqiUZO1U_3 The main framing and details are then continued.
BL4ZqiUZO1U_4 Care must be taken to protect the membrane from penetrations.
BL4ZqiUZO1U_5 All cuts and penetrations should be sealed with tape.
BL4ZqiUZO1U_6 In a situation where you work from the top down or where there is a back set fascia you will need to telescope the lowest course under the next full course of tiles.
BL4ZqiUZO1U_7 In order to hold the panels in plain, you will need to install a filler strip to support the back of the first course in lieu of the batten, usually a 1 inch wide board will suffice.
BMXB5nth8hA_1 I'm with the Kelly White Team, and today we're going to tell you how to buy a house.
BMXB5nth8hA_10 But most of the time it's a pleasant surprise.
BMXB5nth8hA_11 What we do with that prequalification letter, when time comes to present the offer, we always include the prequalification letter for 2 reasons.
BMXB5nth8hA_12 First of all, it shows the seller that you are serious and it shows the realtor that you do have that money to purchase that house.
BMXB5nth8hA_13 A prequalification is really important.
BMXB5nth8hA_2 The prequalification letter; it's very, very important for so many reasons.
BMXB5nth8hA_3 A prequalitfication letter is you're going to meet with a mortgage broker and the mortgage broker is going to run all your numbers, find your credit score and everything.
BMXB5nth8hA_4 It's going to find out how much that bank can lend you.
BMXB5nth8hA_5 Because, this is important, you're not really buying the house, the bank is buying the house.
BMXB5nth8hA_6 The bank is loaning you the money to buy that house.
BMXB5nth8hA_7 This is a a prequalification letter.
BMXB5nth8hA_8 The reason it's important is, first of all, we find out how much you can spend.
BMXB5nth8hA_9 Sometimes it's a pleasant surprise; sometimes it's oh my God.
BZqXT5UYUD8_10 Because when you come home you want to get the calls back to your phone you hit another number and in my case, *73.
BZqXT5UYUD8_11 Listen and it will undo that call forwarding.
BZqXT5UYUD8_12 Each phone company will have a different sequence of numbers.
BZqXT5UYUD8_13 So make sure you check that before you start, take advantage of that facility.
BZqXT5UYUD8_14 But call forwarding is a really, really great tool for home or for business.
BZqXT5UYUD8_15 Kathy Pabst Robshaw telephone effectiveness.
BZqXT5UYUD8_4 It's really easy to do, you can forward a call from your home phone to your cell, to your office, to your neighbor, all you need to do is make sure you've got the number that your phone company has allocated to you.
BZqXT5UYUD8_5 In my case it's 73.
BZqXT5UYUD8_6 I hit *73, here a message, it tells me what to do.
BZqXT5UYUD8_7 Generally, I would put in the number that the call is meant to be forwarded to, and then automatically it happens, I don't think about it.
BZqXT5UYUD8_8 Hang up, walk away, it happens.
BZqXT5UYUD8_9 The easiest thing to do is just make sure that you keep track of the number that you've used so that you can undo it.
BtG-2TZ5Cnk_4 Once again this is something that we, we don't sell a whole lot of these days, but we still would like for you to know a little bit about it just in case any of you all out there still use Chlorine.
BtG-2TZ5Cnk_5 This, this is a very good way of being able to test the level of Chlorine that you have in your water.
BtG-2TZ5Cnk_6 So, with that being said, that's just a little bit about Chlorine Test Papers.
C0fPZgeY2rg_0 How does a snake grow?
C0fPZgeY2rg_1 Well that's a good question.
C0fPZgeY2rg_10 Obviously an adult snake grows a lot less than a baby snake so they are going to shed a lot less but they do need to shed every once in a while to revitalize their scales, repair any damage that may have occurred and continue on with their healthy life.
C0fPZgeY2rg_2 Snakes grow in a kind of different way than we do.
C0fPZgeY2rg_3 People shed skin every day all day as they grow and change and move around.
C0fPZgeY2rg_4 Snake scales are a little different they are more like an armor coating on the outside they don't allow for such free growth so what actually happens is they shed their skin like right down here we have shed skin from a baby corn snake, well not really too much of a baby any more.
C0fPZgeY2rg_5 What they do is they rub their head against something, here's the head over here.
C0fPZgeY2rg_6 They rub their head to split their skin and then slowly roll it off of them kind of like taking off a sock from the top down until this is actually inside out.
C0fPZgeY2rg_7 When it comes off of them and it is inside out.
C0fPZgeY2rg_8 Then you can actually see all the little individual scales on the top and you can see all of the belly scales on the bottom and they do this depending on the size of the snake.
C0fPZgeY2rg_9 A baby snake might shed every week to an adult snake that might shed once a year so it really varies as to how often they're going to shed their skin because it depends on how much they are growing.
C4lsh3mZ4jU_0 Hi!
C4lsh3mZ4jU_11 Now we are up to where the rip begins and we are going to be sewing again just about somewhere between a quarter and eighth of an inch stitches and now we are going to go across the rip and enter here again.
C4lsh3mZ4jU_12 Just about eighth of an inch away from the edge of the rip.
C4lsh3mZ4jU_13 As long as the material isn't fraying and you can put the needle in and it won't be coming out there.
C4lsh3mZ4jU_14 You pull that through.
C4lsh3mZ4jU_15 See how the stitches are coming perpendicular to the rip and let me get a few more and I will show you what to do.
C4lsh3mZ4jU_16 Okay so then once we get a bunch f those, we are going to pull very gently and see how it pulls that rip right together.
C4lsh3mZ4jU_17 It almost looks ike a seam.
C4lsh3mZ4jU_18 So the smaller the stitches, the more delicate the repair will be.
C4lsh3mZ4jU_2 Now I am going to show you how to repair a rip with a blind stitch.
C4lsh3mZ4jU_3 Okay here is our rip and if you are doing a repair you want to match the thread color to the color of the garment.
C4lsh3mZ4jU_4 Match as closely as possible but for purposes of showing you so that you can exactly what I am doing and what the stitch looks like I am going to use black thread.
C4lsh3mZ4jU_5 That should make it easier for you to see this.
C4lsh3mZ4jU_6 You want to knot your thread like I showed you; nice good knot and we are going to come up from the back of the garment about half an inch from the start of the rip.
C4lsh3mZ4jU_7 You are going to come up from the back to the front of the fabric and then you are going to make the needle go back in just a very small amount like a centimeter and take with the needle only less than a quarter inch, probably eighth of inch of fabric and pull very loosely and then you will go on the opposite side of it; where you came out, you go in and take again about somewhere between a quarter and eighth of fabric like this and then you go directly down from it again and but a little bit wider.
C4lsh3mZ4jU_8 You are going to start very small and close and a little wider, a little wider and you will see what we are going to get.
C4lsh3mZ4jU_9_10 There you go. Now your stitches start off small, bigger bigger and they are straight up and down perpendicular to the rip; about an eighth of an inch and go in down here.
C6fVNI9QLYU_1 You can't see it, so I don't know what to explain it, it's not a box blade so whatever, when you have it at an angle, whatever, whatever catches on this side is gonna ride down and gonna run out that side so you're gonna have, you'll have stock piled down at the end.
C6fVNI9QLYU_2 It doesn't gather it up on both side and bring it through.
C6fVNI9QLYU_3 It'll catch snow and push it over to the side of the road or it will catch dirt out of a high spot and move it over to the side.
C6fVNI9QLYU_4 But this, unlike the box blade, is not boxed in, so whatever catches on the front side will roll down the blade and it will eventually go over to the side.
C6fVNI9QLYU_5 And you want that for snow removal or just to get something out of the way because you want to get it out of the road, off to the side of the road, and that's what this kind of blade would be for.
C9ordUxwOEQ_0 This is a tire pressure gauge.
C9ordUxwOEQ_1 You check the pressure of the tires and to change tire pressures every time you come in, depending on track conditions, the track continues to change every single time you go out there.
C9ordUxwOEQ_2 This is really easy to use, its got a number gauge on it.
C9ordUxwOEQ_3 You just hook it up into this valve and it will show you a read.
C9ordUxwOEQ_4 You just read the ticks and you adjust the higher pressure with this little button and it just lets air out of the tire.
C9ordUxwOEQ_5 Its really easy to use.
C9ordUxwOEQ_6 You can put air pressure in the tires by an air tank that is pressurized, the same thing but this is putting pressure in the tire instead of out.
C9ordUxwOEQ_7 It depends on how much the track is changing but most times its only one or two PSI your taking in or out of the tire.
CFRh_KOT9nY_0 Hi, this is Jon, and in this clip we'll be talking about the portable shop table.
CFRh_KOT9nY_1 As you begin to accessorize your wood shop, you might also want to think about purchasing a portable shop table.
CFRh_KOT9nY_2 You'll notice on one side there are wheels at the base of each of the legs, and at the other side we just have our standard feet.
CFRh_KOT9nY_3 Now as you work on your projects around your shop you'll need to move them from station to station, so at this table you'll just lift up on one end and you can easily wheel it to the next station, maybe you're going to a table saw or a planer.
CFRh_KOT9nY_4 Now some of these tables have handles built into them to make them a little bit more ergonomic and comfortable, or if you're looking for more of a custom, mobile workbench, you can always go on line and search for "free mobile workbench plans" and that should bring up several different plans that you can build yourself.
CFRh_KOT9nY_5 Now you'll notice that our workbench here in the shop is made of metal.
CFRh_KOT9nY_6 Now if the surface gets scratched, it will scratch your lumber, so if you're building one or even if you purchase a metal one, you might want to think about putting a wooden top on it so that if it does get scratched, you could refinish it and make it smooth again.
CO6qyvvglAE_0 And now we're going to talk about some inputs that you can run through your board.
CO6qyvvglAE_1 Here we have the Denon DNC635 CD player.
CO6qyvvglAE_10 Important things you need to know about the Denon player is when you want to change tracks you use this button that's called Push, and you turn it sideways.
CO6qyvvglAE_11 Don't push it, turn it sideways.
CO6qyvvglAE_12 And you can see the track numbers is advancing.
CO6qyvvglAE_13 One, two, three.
CO6qyvvglAE_14 OK?
CO6qyvvglAE_15 So there we go.
CO6qyvvglAE_16 That's how you change tracks.
CO6qyvvglAE_17 And when you're ready to play, hit play, obviously.
CO6qyvvglAE_18 Now a great feature of the Denon CD player is, if you decide this is the track you want, instead of hitting pause, which just pauses it, or hitting stop, which actually would bring you back to track one, you can hit, go find the track you want again, track three in this case.
CO6qyvvglAE_19 Hit play.
CO6qyvvglAE_2 Has many features.
CO6qyvvglAE_20 Yes that's what I want.
CO6qyvvglAE_21 And then you hit the Cue button and what that does is, is it brings you back to the beginning of track three.
CO6qyvvglAE_22 So find your track with the, turning this button that says Push on it, paradoxically.
CO6qyvvglAE_23 And then use Cue to go to the beginning of the track you want to play.
CO6qyvvglAE_3 Some of which aren't fantastically useful.
CO6qyvvglAE_4 Let's play some music here.
CO6qyvvglAE_5 OK.
CO6qyvvglAE_6 So it has your basic CD player features.
CO6qyvvglAE_7 Stop, obviously, duh.
CO6qyvvglAE_8 Play, woohoo.
CO6qyvvglAE_9 And you know Pause, no surprise there.
CSxgJLYMLZ4_0 Another very good use, although a slightly more risky use of a wading wedge is carrying a backboard in a cross moving current.
CSxgJLYMLZ4_1 Now while you should attempt to put the backboard in a raft or in something a lot more stationery and steady than a wade this is a last resort, so you can use it.
CSxgJLYMLZ4_2 You need a lot of people, the three people to create the wedge at the front and then a number of people down each side of the backboard where it's positioned in the middle.
CSxgJLYMLZ4_3 The head should be at the front, so that way if the feet get dropped into the water, the water will tend to plane the backboard up to the surface of the water.
CSxgJLYMLZ4_4 Now at all times during this wade you need one person who is designated to maintaining the airway of whoever is on the backboard.
CSxgJLYMLZ4_5 If at any time the backboard drops into the water you've created a very bad situation because that person is trapped on the board.
CSxgJLYMLZ4_6 If you have the opportunity to do this, that person should be facing down stream over them in a better position to maintain their airway.
CW9w6M_1Vrk_0 Now let's add a little shadows to our selection here.
CW9w6M_1Vrk_1 So as you can see we have our sandy text up.
CW9w6M_1Vrk_10 There we go.
CW9w6M_1Vrk_11 Now we got a little roughed up texture going on here.
CW9w6M_1Vrk_12 Seems pretty good.
CW9w6M_1Vrk_13 Go ahead and click edio lased like so.
CW9w6M_1Vrk_14 Let's take our noise and we're just going to leave our noise at zero.
CW9w6M_1Vrk_15 So everything looks pretty good right now so we're going to go ahead and hit OK on this.
CW9w6M_1Vrk_16 As you can see we got a little bit going on here, a little outline coloring and what not so what we're going to do is hit pause here and we'll take this up in the next part.
CW9w6M_1Vrk_2 Let's double click here.
CW9w6M_1Vrk_3 Let's go down to a drop shadows, select that and of course our mode is in multiply and our opasia is at 75 and I like that so far.
CW9w6M_1Vrk_4 Let's switch our angle, let's switch around to, I don't know, what's 30 look like, that looks pretty good.
CW9w6M_1Vrk_5 We'll put it there and let's say our distance, let's take our distance up just a couple more pixels, seven looks pretty good, let's take our spread, let's take it out quite a bit, there we go, now it's gotten pretty funky here.
CW9w6M_1Vrk_6 We're going to take our size, we're going to take it down to zero.
CW9w6M_1Vrk_7 Not it's not so funky, now it's just barely there.
CW9w6M_1Vrk_8 Just around the corner is the right thing.
CW9w6M_1Vrk_9 Let's choose a new contour for this, let's go ahead and click here and let's use, let's use this one right here.
Cw8gcO9TXRo_1 In this clip we're going to talk about what to do once you get on top of the ramp.
Cw8gcO9TXRo_10 Your pedals always wants to be on the 3 and 9 and remember slow to medium speed.
Cw8gcO9TXRo_2 As I said in the overview you're going to get as much as your weight up on the front tire as possible.
Cw8gcO9TXRo_3 You also want to get a spin in there so basically you come up the ramp and you want to get a little bit of a hop and then this way or this way which ever you feel comfortable spinning.
Cw8gcO9TXRo_4 Get on the front tire squeezing the brake and rotating.
Cw8gcO9TXRo_5 When you you cleared the lip here a little bit so that way you don't roll back into it when you get right about here that is when you want to let go of the brake.
Cw8gcO9TXRo_6 You're also going to want a little bit of lean on your tire that way your momentum doesn't just tip you over.
Cw8gcO9TXRo_7 You want to kind of want to lean into the ramp a little bit and that will help with your rotating to.
Cw8gcO9TXRo_8 If you're going too fast, your going to fly up over the bars.
Cw8gcO9TXRo_9 If you're going too slow, your just going to slam your back tire down.
CzkLI34HFIg_0 So I'm going to take these pants over and go ahead and press them down.
CzkLI34HFIg_1 And I'm going to show you how we're going to mark where we're going to cut off the pants.
CzkLI34HFIg_10 Okay, so now that I have this pressed down, I'm going to go ahead and flip these pants back out, because I need to see that excess fabric, so I can determine where I'm going to cut it off.
CzkLI34HFIg_11 Okay, here we go.
CzkLI34HFIg_12 And when I do this, if I have to cut off the fabric I like to leave about an inch excess fabric in the inside.
CzkLI34HFIg_13 And that's a good idea just in case, say someone else wants to wear them, they'll have a little bit to work with.
CzkLI34HFIg_14 If they need to let the hem out, because you can still let the pants out and still have some original hem left.
CzkLI34HFIg_15 So, I'm just going to start right here where I put that one little seam that I sewed myself, and mark 1 inch.
CzkLI34HFIg_16 Here we go.
CzkLI34HFIg_17 And on this side, and also on the next side.
CzkLI34HFIg_18 Okay, it's all the way around.
CzkLI34HFIg_19 So, in a minute I'm going to show you how, I'm going to talk about it and show you how we're going to trim this off.
CzkLI34HFIg_2 So let's go over here to my work table/ironing table, and here we go.
CzkLI34HFIg_20 And I'll show you how to do that next.
CzkLI34HFIg_3 So the first thing I want to do is go ahead and iron this down, just like I did the other leg, just kind of pull it a tiny bit, there we go.
CzkLI34HFIg_4 I'm just going to iron right here along the seam.
CzkLI34HFIg_5 And like I said before, I like do that just because I know the fabric is right were it's supposed to be, and you give it that little press.
CzkLI34HFIg_6 Now this side, okay.
CzkLI34HFIg_7 Then we're going to open it and get that crease that I put there, out.
CzkLI34HFIg_8 I'm going to do the inside also.
CzkLI34HFIg_9 Okay, because we've already done this once, so I'm just going to get after and do it.
D4NatJnEMBU_1 Okay sausage today we're going to do a creole shrimp sausage the thing about creole and cajun cooking or sausage making is that they stuff about anything.
D4NatJnEMBU_2 Into the casings and the sausage of you can do rabbit you can do goose, you can do chicken, turkey, catfish I mean basically anything.
D4NatJnEMBU_3 The trick is to figure out the right seasonings that goes well with those meats that you use for that sausage.
D4NatJnEMBU_4 Today what were going to do is a shrimp creole shrimp sausage it's going to be kind of spicy and were going to use some pork to actually bine that together.
D4NatJnEMBU_5 Another option would be to eliminate the pork and you can actually use egg whites to create that bite.
D4NatJnEMBU_6 For this recipe were going to use a little bit of pork and shrimp to make our fillings so let's get started.
DB2ulH-egkg_0 What we'll do at this point is mount the blanks on the mandrel.
DB2ulH-egkg_1 Once you take off the excess bushings and the nut, slide your blank on, add the second bushing.
DB2ulH-egkg_2 These are important because they will size you on each end.
DB2ulH-egkg_3 Now we couldn't put the second blank on because it is a little bit too long so we'll use a spacer, a washer, and a nut to hold the pieces.
DB2ulH-egkg_4 This has a #2 taper to fit this end and you'll see at this end there is a conical hole.
DB2ulH-egkg_5 The way this works you'll seat it into the mandrel, or into the spindle end, bring up your tail stock with a cone center in it and bring it up snug.
DB2ulH-egkg_6 Don't tighten.
DB2ulH-egkg_7 If you tighten it it is going to cause this to bow and it is going to cause a vibration.
DEdVsXBut4I_0 Ace 2 suited, ace 3 suited; this is pretty much the best Omaha high low hand because what it gives you gives you the aces you can win the high if you catch another ace or two.
DEdVsXBut4I_1 It gives you suited ace 2 and suited ace 3.
DEdVsXBut4I_2 With these, you can pick up a high of a straight, you can pick up a high of a flush and you can pick up a high of a straight flush.
DEdVsXBut4I_3 So you have a number of ways to win a high and also you have a number of ways to win the low.
DEdVsXBut4I_4 What does that mean visually?
DEdVsXBut4I_5 Well let's take a look at this board here that I laid out.
DEdVsXBut4I_6 We got a board of Jack 10 8 3 and 5 and our opponent has played a rather another and for Omaha high low.
DEdVsXBut4I_7 But played it none the less and managed to draw out on us and catch the high of a straight to a queen.
DEdVsXBut4I_8 At last he does not win the low with his 5-2 and he doesn't even qualify for a low because he matches the 5.
DEdVsXBut4I_9 We on the other hand have a low hand, we have 8, 5, 3, deuce, ace so we would win half of the pot.
DGTh2riWSg4_1 Leonin Scimitar is another very powerful artifact equipment.
DGTh2riWSg4_10 Again this is very important and makes it a very powerful card.
DGTh2riWSg4_2 Once again, you have to put it in play and attach it to a creature, do its equip cost to put this into play and on a creature.
DGTh2riWSg4_3 Again, it is an uncommon out of the basic block.
DGTh2riWSg4_4 Once again the basic block is currently in tenth edition as we see from the icon.
DGTh2riWSg4_5 It's an uncommon which means it will cost you forty or fifty cents at your local gaming store.
DGTh2riWSg4_6 Leonin Scimitar costs you one to put in play and costs you one to equip.
DGTh2riWSg4_7 Which means it costs you two to equip it to a creature.
DGTh2riWSg4_8 Well what this calls, you're going to get a plus one, plus one on target creature which doesn't seem that great for two but remember that when that creature goes to a graveyard this stays in play.
DGTh2riWSg4_9 So the next creature it will only take one to equip it to that creature.
DKJtnSrjIro_0 So we have the bottom prepared, and we've got our little bowl that has the pedestal, and this is set up as well.
DKJtnSrjIro_1 It also is leather hard.
DKJtnSrjIro_10 So again, I'm going to spin it, and I'm going to tap it on center.
DKJtnSrjIro_11 And press down in the middle, you notice it slid at first, that was the suction releasing.
DKJtnSrjIro_12 You press down in the middle, and that recreates that suction.
DKJtnSrjIro_13 So it's important that this is hard enough before you start trimming, that you can actually give some good pressure there in the center.
DKJtnSrjIro_14 And next, we'll trim it.
DKJtnSrjIro_2 Now, as you can see when I set it on there, it's a little too big.
DKJtnSrjIro_3 It doesn't quite slip into that pedestal.
DKJtnSrjIro_4 So I have to trim this as well.
DKJtnSrjIro_5 So, what I need to do, in order to trim this, first you want to get the wheel head wet.
DKJtnSrjIro_6 This is important because I just use suction to hold my pieces to the wheel.
DKJtnSrjIro_7 And that's going to happen because when I put this wet lip against this wet piece, and I'm going to drop it kind of hard.
DKJtnSrjIro_8 And now it's sucked on there.
DKJtnSrjIro_9 I'm hitting and it's not moving.
DKOzSnHwSFI_0 Hi, my name is Dave Schoeneck and we're talking about how you're going to feel after your first day of adaptive skiing.
DKOzSnHwSFI_1 In some of the things to prepare would be obviously some upper body stretching.
DKOzSnHwSFI_10 It's going to be how much fun you had and you just wont be able to wait until you get back up and do it again.
DKOzSnHwSFI_2 Upper body and abdominal exercises.
DKOzSnHwSFI_3 That always helps in preparation but after the first day you might be a little sore.
DKOzSnHwSFI_4 You probably will use muscles that you haven't used before but with that soreness will come a tremendous amount of exuberance and having fun.
DKOzSnHwSFI_5 At having being out on the mountain and just you wont be able to wait until you can get back up and ski again.
DKOzSnHwSFI_6 But again, the more and more you can prepare any of your upper body muscles and with weights and stretching the better off you're going to be.
DKOzSnHwSFI_7 Some of the muscles that you'll use would be obviously your forearms, your biceps, your lats, your back.
DKOzSnHwSFI_8 There'll be a number of things you will, can't find muscles that you didn't, forgot you even had but those are really the upper body is doing a awful lot of the work for you and then you just let the ski do the rest of the work.
DKOzSnHwSFI_9 So but again the biggest thing that you're going to think about after your first day is not the aching muscles.
DM2CyN6AA9g_0 You know the line up for flossing, when to floss.
DM2CyN6AA9g_1 You know people will vary in when they like to it.
DM2CyN6AA9g_2 Most of the time what we will find is that you'll floss first and then you'll do your tooth brushing, then you'll do you tongue de-plaquing and then rinsing after that.
DM2CyN6AA9g_3 So, when you are setting up for your hygiene sessions, what you'll want to do is, you'll get everything out.
DM2CyN6AA9g_4 You'll get your floss out as well.
DM2CyN6AA9g_5 And you want to begin by preparing your floss for the actual procedure.
DM2CyN6AA9g_6 Again, usually what we have there is you'll take about anywhere between a twelve and eighteen inch piece of floss and if you are able to floss manually that is all that you would need.
DM2CyN6AA9g_7 If you find you are a person that needs to have a floss aide, that should be at your disposal at that time, as well as there are rings that can be aiding in that circumstance where by the rings will save a spare your fingers from turning blue and from being too tight.
DM2CyN6AA9g_8 So, you'll get whatever aides you have available to help you with this flossing at that time.
DM2CyN6AA9g_9 At this point, what we'll do is prepare to do the actual flossing manually.
Da0LjheLUp0_0 Hi, I'm Danny Botkin from Laughing Dog Farm.
Da0LjheLUp0_1 Today I'm going to talk to you a little bit about about mixing soil.
Da0LjheLUp0_10 Something to give it body, that the plants can grow and send their roots into.
Da0LjheLUp0_2 So to produce large numbers of beautiful food seedlings early in the season we need some good soil.
Da0LjheLUp0_3 And there's a lot to the science of soil, but you...you might know that it's also an art as much as a science.
Da0LjheLUp0_4 So, we're going to be mixing various ingredients into this wheelbarrow to come up with the most rich potting soil that we can to give these valuable, heirloom vegetable seedlings a extremely fast and robust start.
Da0LjheLUp0_5 So what do we need to know about mixing soil?
Da0LjheLUp0_6 Well, essentially, soil is made of clay, silt and sand, three different sized particles.
Da0LjheLUp0_7 Depending on the combination of the clay, silt and sand in your soil, you're going to have a soil that either is well-drained, or not so well-drained, or down right water-logged.
Da0LjheLUp0_8 A good soil is a combination of...of particle sizes, so you have your sand, you have your silt, you have your clay, and then you have organic matter.
Da0LjheLUp0_9 So when we mix soil, we're going to want to bring into the equation organic matter, nutrients in the form of a manure compost, and then something to bulk it up.
DdzxfgB4W2c_0 Okay.
DdzxfgB4W2c_1 Our fish has been in the oven for about 20 minutes, so now it's time to take it out.
DdzxfgB4W2c_10 This is -- we're just going take our knife and the broccoli, and just cut the ends off of our florets like so.
DdzxfgB4W2c_11 Just enough for two people is what we need to do.
DdzxfgB4W2c_12 And if you have more than two people, you're welcome to save these stems and eat them too, if you'd like.
DdzxfgB4W2c_13 I happen to prefer just the broccoli florets.
DdzxfgB4W2c_14 And to this, we're going to go over to the sink so we can put an inch of water.
DdzxfgB4W2c_15 We just need a little bit of water in here at the bottom -- just a little bit of water.
DdzxfgB4W2c_16 And I'm going to put the broccoli florets in here like so.
DdzxfgB4W2c_17 I'm going to cover them, and I'm going to put them on the stove -- here we go -- and I'm going to boil them with high heat.
DdzxfgB4W2c_18 So just that little bit of water is really going to be more like steaming, so it's not going to be overcooked so it's going to be a bright green.
DdzxfgB4W2c_19 And I'm going to check them every once in a while, but it takes about 10 minutes to cook.
DdzxfgB4W2c_2 You can see the garlic is still in there, and here's our fish packet.
DdzxfgB4W2c_20 So keep clicking, we're getting close to putting it all together.
DdzxfgB4W2c_3 Yum.
DdzxfgB4W2c_4 The garlic still needs to cook.
DdzxfgB4W2c_5 Here we go.
DdzxfgB4W2c_6 Now, we're just going to let this sit here and do what I like to call residual cooking.
DdzxfgB4W2c_7 Actually, all meats do that when you take them out of the heat, the heat that's in there continues to cook the meat.
DdzxfgB4W2c_8 And that's what's going to keep it really moist and incredibly delicious texture, soft texture.
DdzxfgB4W2c_9 So meanwhile, let's just quickly do our broccoli.
DfnHNkTE7mE_0 I got my first job back in 1984 on a TV series called Miami Vice.
DfnHNkTE7mE_1 They were down in Miami filming locally, of course, where the series was shot.
DfnHNkTE7mE_10 I think I was a little bit thinner, a lot thinner then and I had really high cheekbones and because of the way I looked, somehow I had a Russian look to me.
DfnHNkTE7mE_11_12 And the director who happened to be Eddie Olmos who played Capt. Castillo on the series, he saw my face and said, "Strong face, great bones.
DfnHNkTE7mE_13 Looks Russian to me.
DfnHNkTE7mE_14 Let's put him in the suit", so to speak.
DfnHNkTE7mE_15 So I was an ex-KGB guy running around trying to kill Crockett and Tubbs with a machine gun for most of the show.
DfnHNkTE7mE_16 I think the biggest break for me working in film was being associated with a real high quality project.
DfnHNkTE7mE_17 I did Monster with Charlize Theron in 2004.
DfnHNkTE7mE_18 And it was a little independent movie.
DfnHNkTE7mE_19 It was actually lower that the Screen Actors Guild's standard, and we all got a low budget pay for it.
DfnHNkTE7mE_2 And a call came out to all the actors, aspiring actors in the area, that a casting director was looking for people that had skill and were comfortable in front of a camera, to work on a TV show called Miami Vice.
DfnHNkTE7mE_20 But, you know, that's the great thing about this business, you never know where or how the project you're taking might develop or create a buzz or get elevated, you know, as some films do.
DfnHNkTE7mE_21 And for her, it got her an Academy Award.
DfnHNkTE7mE_22 So I was in a scene with Charlize Theron in Monster.
DfnHNkTE7mE_23 And during the course of all the accolades and awards that she received for that, I think that it was either the Screen Actors Guild Award show, which was telecast on TNT or something, Turner's Broadcasting who showed that, she mentioned my name.
DfnHNkTE7mE_24 She thanked me.
DfnHNkTE7mE_25 And I only worked one night with her.
DfnHNkTE7mE_26 We had a long scene to do.
DfnHNkTE7mE_27 I remember it being very cold and I was very bloody and in my underwear, which makes you wonder, wow, I've got to go back and rent that now.
DfnHNkTE7mE_28 So yeah, do that, go rent it because residuals also help us actors and anything you can do to help me, I'd appreciate it.
DfnHNkTE7mE_29 So, go rent the movie and check out the scene.
DfnHNkTE7mE_3 So I went in, not knowing what to expect, really, you know.
DfnHNkTE7mE_4 This was my first introduction to it and I got sides.
DfnHNkTE7mE_5 And I was told, you know, "Memorize these sides or look at them and then come back in and I'm going to put you on camera doing this."
DfnHNkTE7mE_6 So I did that and they liked me.
DfnHNkTE7mE_7 And I got hired as an actor on Miami Vice.
DfnHNkTE7mE_8 That was my first job.
DfnHNkTE7mE_9 And I was playing a Russian KGB agent.
DwlVtUKfv3s_0 As you are getting ready for the ball to come over the net and to hit it, it's important that you're moving side to side and then bouncing on the balls of your feet.
DwlVtUKfv3s_1 You should never just stay put.
DwlVtUKfv3s_2 You should be moving because that's going to give you the energy to get the ball.
DwlVtUKfv3s_3 You should have your knees bent, your feet spread out, moving side to side.
DwlVtUKfv3s_4 Then your back should be angled so that you are ready to move.
DwlVtUKfv3s_5 If you were leaning back like this it's going to be harder to get up to go get the ball.
DwlVtUKfv3s_6 So when it's all working right, you're going to have your feet moving all the time, your hands and your racket moving side to side, your shoulders, your eyes following the ball.
DyehHuc_Whk_0 Okay everybody, let me share with your some other ideas that you can use in a complete routine.
DyehHuc_Whk_1 I did a lot of them with you.
DyehHuc_Whk_10 Don't be afraid to combine a bunch of the stuff I showed you and use some of your own ideas as well to create a full routine that you can do for your friends and family.
DyehHuc_Whk_11 Have fun with the Svengali deck.
DyehHuc_Whk_2 Any of the tricks that we've talked about, any of the principles that we talked about with the Svengali deck you can certainly use in a routine.
DyehHuc_Whk_3 Put something together that you think is entertaining.
DyehHuc_Whk_4 One thing I did want to talk about, this is kind of interesting.
DyehHuc_Whk_5 What you want to do is get a queen of clubs that's cut normally.
DyehHuc_Whk_6 You want to stick it on top of your deck and then you want to have them pick a card like this, and then you're going to pull a normal queen of clubs right off the top of the deck because you don't want to use one of your cut short cards for this.
DyehHuc_Whk_7 Then you could tear this up and make it vanish using any other methods we talked about in some of the other card videos, and you can produce another one from your pocket.
DyehHuc_Whk_8 That's another idea you could use.
DyehHuc_Whk_9 You could do this whole routine that we talked about with all the cards looking the same and everything and then have a prediction sealed in an envelope.
E1prpF9WgrE_0 My name is Abby Jones and we are talking about moving into a new space and how to make that process easy and efficient.
E1prpF9WgrE_1 So, right now specifically, we're talking about how to arrange furniture in your living space.
E1prpF9WgrE_10 The pillows, because I have a small space, I'm actually going to put them over to one side of my shelves as storage, but I can pull them out when guests come over, or when I want to, to put them on the floor next to my coffee table so people can sit on them.
E1prpF9WgrE_11 Something I like to think about when I'm placing chairs, although I won't have any in this particular living space, is creating kind of, conversation group areas, so think about your house.
E1prpF9WgrE_12 If you had three people come over to your house, or four people, how could they all sit so that nobody felt like they were on the other side of the universe or, or your living room, as it may be.
E1prpF9WgrE_13 And, how you can create small intimate spaces within your larger space.
E1prpF9WgrE_2 So, other than your couch, and coffee table, and shelves which are pieces that a lot of people have, their miscellaneous pieces of furniture that will vary from household to household.
E1prpF9WgrE_3 Some of the miscellaneous pieces of furniture that I have, are this stool that goes along with my couch, I have a footstool kind of thing.
E1prpF9WgrE_4 And these big pillows that I like to use to sit on, that I put out when guests come over and that kind of thing.
E1prpF9WgrE_5 Other pieces of furniture that people might have are additional chairs, side tables, a T.V.
E1prpF9WgrE_6 table, these kinds of things.
E1prpF9WgrE_7 So, things to think about when you're placing this furniture is just, things that I like to think about are how to create intimate and harmonious spaces.
E1prpF9WgrE_8 So, for instances what I'm going to do with this, with my, with this footstool is since I don't have that much room in my living space, the central living space.
E1prpF9WgrE_9 I'm actually going to put it behind my couch, so that it's over here and that will help, that would I guess fall under the category of creating a harmonious space because it's not going to be just sitting out in the middle of somewhere.
EJmna7hpk4M_1 Another important aspect of the pre-flight is to check our control surfaces.
EJmna7hpk4M_10 We have one on each wing.
EJmna7hpk4M_11 We want to check also for freedom of movement.
EJmna7hpk4M_12 And in this case, we want to make certain that when one goes up, the other one goes down.
EJmna7hpk4M_13 On the underside of the Aileron, we also want to check the three hinge points, to make sure that all the bolts are secure, and that the hinge pins are also in place and secure.
EJmna7hpk4M_14 And now some freedom of movement.
EJmna7hpk4M_2 We're going to check, just like with the other structural stuff, we want to check and make sure that all the rivets and all the farings are in good shape, no cracks or any damage there.
EJmna7hpk4M_3 We want to check for freedom of movement, so we want to be able to move this.
EJmna7hpk4M_4 No binding sounds, nothing of the nature.
EJmna7hpk4M_5 We also want to check in the cockpit, while we're doing this, and make sure that the control yoke is moving the proper way.
EJmna7hpk4M_6 While we're here we also want to check the trim tab, this is an integral part of our elevator.
EJmna7hpk4M_7 Make sure that that has freedom of movement as well.
EJmna7hpk4M_8 We also want to check the rudder control surface as well, and make sure that we have some movement here, and no binding, and make certain that there's no damage to the skin or rivets here as well.
EJmna7hpk4M_9 On the wing we want to check our ailerons.
EMcUlzfIkwc_0 Hi!
EMcUlzfIkwc_10 If you can get them all going the same way, that'll work.
EMcUlzfIkwc_11 Go against the way you cut before.
EMcUlzfIkwc_12 Scoop them together.
EMcUlzfIkwc_13 If you want to pivot your edge of your knife on one side and fan out, that'll help as well.
EMcUlzfIkwc_14 Then find a new pivot point, so that way you're just cutting the exact same thing.
EMcUlzfIkwc_15 You want your pieces to end up about that big.
EMcUlzfIkwc_2 Now we're going to talk about chopping up our onion for our garlic tomato bruschetta.
EMcUlzfIkwc_3 You need about 1/4 cup of onion.
EMcUlzfIkwc_4 What you want to do is cut it in really thin slices.
EMcUlzfIkwc_5 We're going to mince this.
EMcUlzfIkwc_6 Other side.
EMcUlzfIkwc_7 Set that to the side.
EMcUlzfIkwc_8 As you can see, the pieces are pretty thin.
EMcUlzfIkwc_9 That'll help for the mincing part.
EOfDkxQENkc_0 Today I am going to be cornrowing my baby sister's hair.
EOfDkxQENkc_1 Her name is Ashley.
EOfDkxQENkc_10 It's called extensions.
EOfDkxQENkc_11 And we're going to be cornrowing that into her hair today.
EOfDkxQENkc_12 So thanks for joining us and we look forward to walking you step by step through cornrowing Ashley's hair.
EOfDkxQENkc_2 Hi.
EOfDkxQENkc_3 Ashley is 12 years old and she's got a great head of hair.
EOfDkxQENkc_4 We don't look much alike because many of my siblings in my home and my family are adopted.
EOfDkxQENkc_5 We'll talk a little bit more about that.
EOfDkxQENkc_6 But Ashley has been one of my models since she was a baby girl.
EOfDkxQENkc_7 And I've been doing her hair and many other people's hair for a long time now.
EOfDkxQENkc_8 But today we're going to be cornrowing her hair.
EOfDkxQENkc_9 Specifically we're going to be putting in false hair.
EQWFrWeRVjQ_1 And today, we're going to learn how to set up a drum kit.
EQWFrWeRVjQ_10 So we can take this, loosen it, and we're going to tighten that.
EQWFrWeRVjQ_11 We're just eyeballing this right now.
EQWFrWeRVjQ_12 We will have to definitely adjust.
EQWFrWeRVjQ_13 And I'm going to take this one and extend it a little bit more.
EQWFrWeRVjQ_14 And then this is the boom, and then this is the head.
EQWFrWeRVjQ_15 We'll loosen--go ahead and loosen both of those and get the head to where you think it's close enough to an angle--a good angle, and then the boom and tighten.
EQWFrWeRVjQ_16 You might wanna--it looks like it's a little [INDISCERNIBLE].
EQWFrWeRVjQ_17 I'm just eyeballing it.
EQWFrWeRVjQ_18 I think that is pretty close for right now.
EQWFrWeRVjQ_2 So now that all the drums are set up and we've set up our hi-hat stand, we're going to set up our first crash cymbal stand.
EQWFrWeRVjQ_3 Same concept, loosen the wing nut and spread the legs to a nice sturdy situation.
EQWFrWeRVjQ_4 And we're going to tighten it up.
EQWFrWeRVjQ_5 Now, what you want to do here - this is kind of important - you want to take this first leg or one leg and you want to put it facing the inside of your drum set or facing where you're going to be sitting, because when you hit it from that angle you don't want it to tip over.
EQWFrWeRVjQ_6 See if you'd hit it from here, there's a possibility that it could tip.
EQWFrWeRVjQ_7 So we set it there.
EQWFrWeRVjQ_8 That's a good place right now for it.
EQWFrWeRVjQ_9 And now, we have to extend it.
ETOZLBScxWY_0 Hi, this is John Stewart and this is some repair tips for your tent.
ETOZLBScxWY_1 The first thing you're going to run into when repairing a tent, is you normally get small holes, rips in your tent, the mesh and other parts of the tent.
ETOZLBScxWY_10 This will get you through a camping trip, but you'll probably want to replace your pole after that.
ETOZLBScxWY_11 If the pole's bungee breaks on the inside, the pole will still go together, it's just that you have to put it together piece by piece instead of just having it snap together.
ETOZLBScxWY_12 If your rain fly begins to leak, or your tent begins to leak, you need to take and replace the seam sealing on it.
ETOZLBScxWY_13 You just buy a tube of seam sealer, run it across the seams, and this will waterproof your seams to where you don't have any leaks or drains into your tent.
ETOZLBScxWY_14 If you have punctures in your ground fly, you probably ought to replace the ground fly, because this is the main protector from the bottom of your tent, so you don't want to have any punctures or anything like that in your ground fly.
ETOZLBScxWY_15 And this is how, some repair tips for setting up your tent.
ETOZLBScxWY_2 The easiest way to repair these is Duct tape.
ETOZLBScxWY_3 You can put a piece of Duct tape on the inside of the rip, and on the outside of the rip, and just sandwich it together.
ETOZLBScxWY_4 This stuff will hold up during your camping trip, but you do want to get it further repaired once you get back.
ETOZLBScxWY_5 Other things you might run into is a broken pole.
ETOZLBScxWY_6 Poles will tend to crack once they get bent into funky shapes that you might put them into.
ETOZLBScxWY_7 When you do encounter this, if the crack is small, once again, put some Duct tape over it and this will keep it from expanding and getting bigger.
ETOZLBScxWY_8 If you break a pole in half, you can repair this be having an extra farel, or a pole protector.
ETOZLBScxWY_9 Another way to do this, is to take two really hard sticks, duct tape them on there together.
Eh2AVkAQsxI_0 Hi I'm Lauren, I'm going to be discussing how to add natural highlights at home.
Eh2AVkAQsxI_1 If you do not feel as though you would like to go to a salon, and just want to add your or change your color up a little bit, to add a little bit more dimension you can go to any drugstore or any beauty destination and get a hair home lightening kit.
Eh2AVkAQsxI_10 Very gently and lay them down.
Eh2AVkAQsxI_11 So that maybe they are not even directly touching that hair that's underneath.
Eh2AVkAQsxI_12 It will prevent any spotting and any errors that could occur.
Eh2AVkAQsxI_13 So you are going to put it down, very gently ,just kind of release it.
Eh2AVkAQsxI_14 You can do that all throughout the head so that way you can lighten as many sections as you want.
Eh2AVkAQsxI_15 The one nice thing is that this is a little bit more paste so you can kind of say I like a highlight here and then you can actually put that highlight there.
Eh2AVkAQsxI_16 If you do have a lighter hair color, more of like your very light brown, or your dark blonde the home hair kit hair lightening systems may work out a little bit better for you.
Eh2AVkAQsxI_17 If your hair is very dark you may just want to go to your local salon because there width actions tends to not be as strong as what a professional can get and what will happen is it will leave your highlights looking very brassy, very like very orangey and very, very bright.
Eh2AVkAQsxI_18 I tend to find that people with a lighter base color have a bit of an easier time and better results in doing home hair lighting kits.
Eh2AVkAQsxI_19 And that is how to lighten your hair at home.
Eh2AVkAQsxI_2 Ultimately you will mix up whatever the hair lightener is that they give you.
Eh2AVkAQsxI_3 And it will come with a little bit of a brush such as this or it may have a little bit more harder bristle then this one actually does.
Eh2AVkAQsxI_4 You will then simply mix up everything that they give you, and follow the directions that they give you.
Eh2AVkAQsxI_5 And you would paint it on your hair.
Eh2AVkAQsxI_6 The best way to do that is to dip your brush in and then literally stroke it on to tiny sections that you would like to be lighter.
Eh2AVkAQsxI_7_8 Lay them gently over the rest of the hair and then let them go. You would do this with each section.
Eh2AVkAQsxI_9 You do not want to push them down because what will happen is that it will start to lighten those hairs underneath and it will cause you to have spots.
EhYk6e-jtWg_0 Alright, the drink that we are about to make is a Claridge Cocktail.
EhYk6e-jtWg_1 And we are going to serve this as a martini so if you want to set your martini glass to the side with some water and ice in it, that will get it nice and cool for when you're ready to serve the drink.
EhYk6e-jtWg_10 We got our martini glass and a strainer.
EhYk6e-jtWg_11 Go ahead and pour it in.
EhYk6e-jtWg_12 Great.
EhYk6e-jtWg_13 That is a Claridge cocktail.
EhYk6e-jtWg_14 Bottoms up!
EhYk6e-jtWg_2 Now we got our ice in a glass and we're going to do one shot of gin.
EhYk6e-jtWg_3 And follow that up with a shot of dry vermouth.
EhYk6e-jtWg_4 And next we will do a tablespoon of apricot brandy and also a tablespoon of triple sec.
EhYk6e-jtWg_5 Alright.
EhYk6e-jtWg_6 Now let's shake these ingredients up real well.
EhYk6e-jtWg_7 We're going to be serving it up with no ice.
EhYk6e-jtWg_8 You want to make sure you get it nice and cold so that it will stay cold while the person is drinking it.
EhYk6e-jtWg_9 There we go.
EjzQn4ReeeI_0 Alright, in this clip we'll be doing the upper body on our cute, more cartoonized angel, and we're just going to give him a simple, white robe.
EjzQn4ReeeI_1 So we're going to start by drawing his neck in there like that, maybe give him sort of a v-neck shape to his robe there.
EjzQn4ReeeI_10 You got the top of his robe, his sleeves, little belt there, his hands, and that will work well for his upper body.
EjzQn4ReeeI_11 And in the next clip we'll move on to the lower half of his body.
EjzQn4ReeeI_2 Draw the top edges of it.
EjzQn4ReeeI_3 Now, we're just going to come down and do his shoulders, just like that.
EjzQn4ReeeI_4 Swing down, swoop down and give him some flowing robes here.
EjzQn4ReeeI_5 We're going to draw the sleeves coming into his side like that, and as you draw his robe coming down to where his belt would be, kind of give it a little bit of a outward curve, so that when you come in and draw his belt, like that, it leaves a little bit of a realistic little space where the fabric would kind of bend in there like that, like that.
EjzQn4ReeeI_6 You add a little swooping detail to the robe like that, and then just draw his hands in there.
EjzQn4ReeeI_7 Standard cartoon hands, with the four fingers.
EjzQn4ReeeI_8 This guy definitely looks like he's wishing us peace on earth and good will to men.
EjzQn4ReeeI_9 And there.
EmNBzTLRz-E_0 ALICE MONSAERT: This exercise is what I call an advanced level lunge because the back leg is going to stay straight.
EmNBzTLRz-E_1 In our regular lunge, we should bend the back knee.
EmNBzTLRz-E_10 So, I'm going to go into that forward advanced level lunge with the back leg is straight, do a reverse fly, and come up.
EmNBzTLRz-E_11 So, again, my challenge comes from this forward foot being on the unstable surface.
EmNBzTLRz-E_12 Forward, and one more safety point for you, we never want the spine rounded.
EmNBzTLRz-E_13 We want it lifted, chest open, and reverse fly.
EmNBzTLRz-E_2 In this exercise, the back leg is going to stay straight while the body moves forward over the forward quadriceps.
EmNBzTLRz-E_3 So, we're going to do this onto BOSU and incorporate again an upper body exercise along with it.
EmNBzTLRz-E_4 I like to do a lot of back work because typically our anterior is tight and our back is stretched, so it's nice to have muscle balance and do a lot of back work.
EmNBzTLRz-E_5 So, the advanced level lunge, I stay up on the toe on the back, get the heel off the floor, keep the legs straight, the knee silently soft, lunge forward, and then come straight.
EmNBzTLRz-E_6 So, as I lunge, my knees staying over the center of my foot.
EmNBzTLRz-E_7 If your knee goes past to your toe, then just scoot your back leg forward--or back leg back a little bit, and we're going to incorporate a row.
EmNBzTLRz-E_8 So, I'm going to lunge, row, and come up.
EmNBzTLRz-E_9 Lunge forward, row for the back of the shoulders, the lats, or I can change that to incorporate a reverse fly.
Enhria4v_jo_0 Hi, I'm Judy Carrier with Jewels by Park Lane and I'm going to tell you how to clean your sterling silver jewelry.
Enhria4v_jo_1 First of all you put a pot of water on to boil, just like you would if you're having a baby in the old movies.
Enhria4v_jo_10 But pour the water off when it's quit fizzing and take it out, rinse it and pat it dry with a lint free cloth and your jewelry should look as good as new.
Enhria4v_jo_11 I'm Judy Carrier with Jewels by Park Lane and that's how you clean sterling silver jewelry.
Enhria4v_jo_2 Get a glass pot or an aluminum pan, either one will work.
Enhria4v_jo_3 If you have a glass pot or something just fill it, line it with aluminum foil, just plain old aluminum foil that you use on the turkey.
Enhria4v_jo_4 And then take some baking soda and sprinkle it liberally over the foil.
Enhria4v_jo_5 Put your jewelry in there.
Enhria4v_jo_6 Set it in and then you pour the hot water over it.
Enhria4v_jo_7 Now it's going to fizz up, smell kind of like rotten eggs, it's not the nicest smelling.
Enhria4v_jo_8 You let it sit there a while until it's completely dissolved and you might want to shake the pan a little or just stir it to make sure that the baking powder is completely dissolved.
Enhria4v_jo_9 And while that is cleaning, you might want to air out the windows or something, but open a window to get that smell out.
FMSiqrDXABU_0 Okay, right now we're going to talk about laying out the job.
FMSiqrDXABU_1 What you're going to want to do is, go and measure where the fence is going to be, and make yourself a hand drawn diagram.
FMSiqrDXABU_2 Here we've measured out our yard, and determined that we're going to have a certain footage on this side, along the back the other side, and drawn it out how we want it to lay out with the fence and the gates.
FMSiqrDXABU_3 From this hand drawn diagram, you can then come up with a custom layout, depending on what spacing you want to set your post.
FMSiqrDXABU_4 We've got a custom layout here that goes right along with that hand drawn diagram.
FMSiqrDXABU_5 Where we've taken a 77 inch center to center spacing, which is a 72 inch opening between post, and figured out what each side- how many sections would be on each side, determining which post would be required, and how many of each kind of post.
FMSiqrDXABU_6 With this diagram, you can then prepare to lay out the job on the ground.
FS0f1ytiWGE_0 Hi, I'm Michael Burton, with michaelburtonfilms.org, located in Salt Lake City, Utah, and we're here talking about using Microsoft Windows.
FS0f1ytiWGE_1 Now I want to talk to you about how to save a file with a different name.
FS0f1ytiWGE_10 Now, let's save this document.
FS0f1ytiWGE_11 We've save, it's let's just go ahead and save as, and we're going to choose it to go to our desktop, okay.
FS0f1ytiWGE_12 Now down here, we can, it automatically chooses the first couple letters of our of our text, so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and change this to Test Document, and then we're going to scroll over here to save, and it's automatically going to save it to the desktop.
FS0f1ytiWGE_13 So now, as you can see up in the upper left hand corner, our document now is called Test Document Microsoft Word.
FS0f1ytiWGE_14 Let's go ahead and close out of this document.
FS0f1ytiWGE_15 Now, as you can see over here on our desktop, we've created a file called Test Document.
FS0f1ytiWGE_16 What I'm going to do is I'm going to double click on this and reopen this, because what we want to do is let's say a couple months have gone by and our test document; whatever we typed in there was really important, but we need to make some changes, but even though we make the changes we still want to keep the original file.
FS0f1ytiWGE_17 So what we're going to do is we're going to open our original file, and then let's say we want to make some changes by maybe dropping some of this text down, you know, maybe you want to add some text here, maybe you want to add in some numbers or something.
FS0f1ytiWGE_18 Then what we're going to do is we we'd when we go up to file we don't want to click save, because what that's going to do is overwrite our existing test document, thus erasing what we'd had originally.
FS0f1ytiWGE_19 So, if we want to keep the original and save this as a a new separate file we're going to want to go to save as again.
FS0f1ytiWGE_2 This is very helpful.
FS0f1ytiWGE_20 Now, this time when it comes up it's going to bring it up as the old name, Test Document.
FS0f1ytiWGE_21 You do not want to click save just yet.
FS0f1ytiWGE_22 Let's say we want to add in Test Document 2, so that we have like part 2; actually, better yet, let's write Part 2, Test Document Part 2.
FS0f1ytiWGE_23 Now we can either hit enter or left click with our mouse on save.
FS0f1ytiWGE_24 We've chosen to save it to the desktop.
FS0f1ytiWGE_25 It now saves, if you look in the upper left hand corner, as Test Document Part 2.
FS0f1ytiWGE_26 We can now close this document, and we see that on our desktop we have now created, we now have two documents created.
FS0f1ytiWGE_27 We have Test Document and Test Document Part 2.
FS0f1ytiWGE_28 That is how you successfully save a file with a different name, thus organizing your desktop or your your computer a lot better.
FS0f1ytiWGE_3 For example, if you create a file in word or Excel, and then you decide you want to change the name, or like let's say for example, you're creating a spreadsheet for your budget for the month of January, and then come the next month you want to use the same spreadsheet, but it's for the month of February, and you want to separate.
FS0f1ytiWGE_4 You don't want to re-save over the January one, so you're going to want to relabel that February, and save it to either the same location or another location, and so I'm going to show you how to do that.
FS0f1ytiWGE_5 Let me start out by saying that Windows XP is a registered trademark of Microsoft, and I am in no way affiliated with Microsoft.
FS0f1ytiWGE_6 Okay, to save a file with a different name is very important because you might want to reuse some of the same files and eventually change the name so that you don't re-save over the the old file so that you still have the old file.
FS0f1ytiWGE_7 I've gone ahead and opened a Word document here called Document 1.
FS0f1ytiWGE_8 That is the default name for any Word document when I open it up.
FS0f1ytiWGE_9 We are going to go ahead and just type in a bunch of jargon here, okay.
Fr0hSHhEpzY_0 Did you know that Vista can actually use more than one processor?
Fr0hSHhEpzY_1 Hi I'm Dan Afonso of Enfold IT and Afonso Consulting and this is how to set Vista Processor Affinity.
Fr0hSHhEpzY_10 This is a 2 processor machine starting at 0 so I'm going to tell it now it can only run on CPU 1 so hit o'kay.
Fr0hSHhEpzY_11 Boom, that's it.
Fr0hSHhEpzY_12 Now you shouldn't need to do this very often.
Fr0hSHhEpzY_13 Really it is only going to happen if you are doing a lot of video editing, sound processing or anything that just requires a lot of processor time and it should be used with caution because it can wind up annoying or just otherwise making programs run kind of funny but used properly it will make your experience a little bit better and you know make Vista a little bit more tolerable.
Fr0hSHhEpzY_14 I'm Dan Afonso and that was how to set processor Affinity on Vista.
Fr0hSHhEpzY_2 Processor Affinity is a fancy way of saying you can allocate which processors run for which application.
Fr0hSHhEpzY_3 Now you want to do this if you have an application that uses a lot of resources and you really don't want it running on all your processors taking up all their time or if you want to split up your processes across CPU's in a bit more of an organized fashion rather than letting Vista do it itself.
Fr0hSHhEpzY_4 It's not a very common thing but if you're burning a DVD, if you're making videos, if you're doing anything that requires a lot of processor time and still want your machine to be usable it's a really good thing to know.
Fr0hSHhEpzY_5 So what we're going to do is I am just going to bring up the task manager by right clicking on task bar, clicking on task manager.
Fr0hSHhEpzY_6 Now over here we are going to see a lot of programs under the processes tab, find the one you want.
Fr0hSHhEpzY_7 I'm just going to grab one of them and set the affinity.
Fr0hSHhEpzY_8 Now it's going to come up with what can I set it to?
Fr0hSHhEpzY_9 I can set it to CPU 0 or CPU 1.
_2FBDaOPYig_1 Today I am going to be showing you how to make Gourmet French Fries cooked in duck fat.
_2FBDaOPYig_10 But like I said be really really careful.
_2FBDaOPYig_11 It has already popped on me twice; really really big.
_2FBDaOPYig_12 Like 2 foot high oil explosions so just be really really careful and make sure you don't burn your house down and don't burn yourself.
_2FBDaOPYig_2 So we are currently heating up the oil and at this point, you are going to want to be very very careful unless you rendered the duck fat yourself.
_2FBDaOPYig_3 I bought this at the store and there appears to be a great deal of moisture in the actual fat.
_2FBDaOPYig_4 So what is happening, you see all the bubbles on top right there.
_2FBDaOPYig_5 That is the water coming out of the oil which means it was probably improperly stored at the store or it was allowed to partially thaw and then refrigerate.
_2FBDaOPYig_6 I am going to let this go until I don't see any bubbles in there.
_2FBDaOPYig_7 I do have it a little hotter than usual.
_2FBDaOPYig_8 It's about 350 right now and I want to get it to 325.
_2FBDaOPYig_9 So I am just going to turn the heat down a little bit and let it back off some and wait for these bubbles to come out.
_5CV2fIG7qY_2 The first thing you want to do is make sure you get you a very good quality piece of equipment.
_5CV2fIG7qY_3 This bow here, I'm very fortunate, the bow tech named it after me, they call it "The General".
_5CV2fIG7qY_4 And it's an incredible bow, I'm really impressed with the way the bow shoots, it is an amazing product.
_5CV2fIG7qY_5 This is a little device I found, it makes it easier to keep in the blind to make it stand up but you've got to make sure you've got a good stabilizer on it.
_5CV2fIG7qY_6 I like this little wrist sling, it gives you comfort when you're holding the bow.
_5CV2fIG7qY_7 Different sights, this is a lighted sight; you can turn on whenever the light's dim on it.
_5CV2fIG7qY_8 This is a dual cam system with a foldaway rest.
_5CV2fIG7qY_9 A lot of people don't do the rope on the bow, or the rubber deal on it, but I always want to make sure that this is back and lined up perfect every time in a hunting situation, and that's primarily what I do, is hunting.
_64bCfimlk8_6 Now you know how to actually play the game there is another element called speeding up we would take a look at that in the next clip.
_7uBzSGPQis_1 But take your shoulders right back.
_7uBzSGPQis_10 Exhale, bring your chin right in towards your chest, inhale lift up tall and exhale bring your chin towards you chest.
_7uBzSGPQis_2 You start off by opening the sternum, the center part of your chest, promoting positive feelings in the body.
_7uBzSGPQis_3 So shoulders go right back.
_7uBzSGPQis_4 The arms just hang down relaxed so they can touch your thighs.
_7uBzSGPQis_5 Let your chin go up and as the chin goes up toward the ceiling the thyroid is exposed.
_7uBzSGPQis_6 Now here where the chest opens is a four chakra and the throat is a fifth chakra.
_7uBzSGPQis_7 Take a deep breath in through your nose.
_7uBzSGPQis_8 On the exhale, keeping your shoulders back, let the chin come in towards you chest.
_7uBzSGPQis_9 Massaging the thyroid, inhale and lift right up tall.
_b1ZDanAjuA_0 The foot placement required for a switch boardslide is very similar to the foot placement for the regular boardslide, just picture everything backwards, the only difference is going to be is imagine you are getting into a switch front side 180 because the foot position needed is very similar to that.
_b1ZDanAjuA_1 What you are going to do is hang the tip of your toe over the board or the tip of your heel and just a bit of toe.
_b1ZDanAjuA_2 The reason for this is that you need to get a 90 degree switch ollie and this is going to help you push the board in that direction.
_b1ZDanAjuA_3 The other foot has to be right behind the trucks and the reason for this is so that when you get into the switch boardslide it ends up being about right here, that is the only way you are going to be able to get out of the boardslide is if you have your foot on the tail so that you can put the weight to get out of the switch boardslide.
_b1ZDanAjuA_4 So remember similar to a switch front slide 180 and imagine with any switch trick it is like turning it around and doing it the other way so if you already know how to do a boardslide just imagine the mirror image of the foot placement that is needed and you can imagine how it will be for the foot placement for the switch boardslide.
a1HVL0zE768_2 And then from Tadasana, standing on your left leg, bend the right knee.
a1HVL0zE768_3 Take the strap back to the balls of the toes, and stretch your right leg straight out in front of you, good.
a1HVL0zE768_4 Now keep the effort even in both legs and stretch your left arm out to the left, and as the left arm goes to the left, open the right hip toward the right.
a1HVL0zE768_5 Good, effort in the legs, but then surrender and softness, so a little wavering is totally fine.
a1HVL0zE768_6 Inhale, come back to center, exhale, and release.
a1HVL0zE768_7 And let me show you with a wall just in case.
a1HVL0zE768_8 If it's harder to balance you can come and take one hand to the wall.
a1HVL0zE768_9 Standing on the right leg, bend the left knee, take the strap to the foot, and then stretch the left leg out in front, and then you just have the wall right there for your steadiness.
a4Nxq0QV_WA_0 JASON JEANETTE: Hi.
a4Nxq0QV_WA_1 I'm Jason Jeanette.
a4Nxq0QV_WA_10 He's going to stand me up on my neck which is not really comfortable.
a4Nxq0QV_WA_11 I'm not ready to abandon my technique yet.
a4Nxq0QV_WA_12 I'm going to maintain control of my left hand, just keeping it tight, keep my knees together and keep him from escaping.
a4Nxq0QV_WA_13 I'm going to let go of my right hand, I'm going to grab his heel.
a4Nxq0QV_WA_14 I'm going to lift this leg and throw it that way as I throw my feet towards the floor here, maintaining control, again keep my knees together and then bridge.
a4Nxq0QV_WA_3 DANIEL KLAPHEKE: This is another version of a counter to an arm bar defense.
a4Nxq0QV_WA_4 Setting up the arm bar, I want to make sure I control one arm and with the same side and put that with same foot on his hip.
a4Nxq0QV_WA_5 Remember to turn 90 degrees in bringing this leg up in a good situation.
a4Nxq0QV_WA_6 I'll bring this one here and clamp this one straight down towards the floor, pinch the knees together and bridge up.
a4Nxq0QV_WA_7 What we're going to soon know as he feels it coming or I'm just too slow.
a4Nxq0QV_WA_8 If in this position he's going to stack me.
a4Nxq0QV_WA_9 Okay?
a4uz0W33REs_0 SARAH HAUER: Hi.
a4uz0W33REs_1 I'm Sarah Hauer.
a4uz0W33REs_10 SIG HAUER: That mu point, particular point is referred to as Yin Ton.
a4uz0W33REs_11 It's a very calming point.
a4uz0W33REs_2 SIG HAUER: And I'm Sig Hauer, and we're professional practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine.
a4uz0W33REs_4 SIG HAUER: And welcome to our video.
a4uz0W33REs_5 Again, I just want to remind you that this is just a demonstration.
a4uz0W33REs_6 This would be in a much more private [OVERLAPPING] SARAH HAUER: You okay?
a4uz0W33REs_7 So what I'm doing is just gathering the skin up a little bit so it makes for a very painless insertion then I tap the needle in, get the Chi and that's it.
a4uz0W33REs_8 Is that okay, Ellen?
a4uz0W33REs_9 ELLEN: Uh-huh.
a5yNwUSiYpA_0_1 Ok. What I'm going to be performing here is called a front squat. Now, the traditional squat usually you see the bar behind the neck.
a5yNwUSiYpA_10 Keep your body steady throughout the whole flow.
a5yNwUSiYpA_11 Do about, depending on the amount of weight you're doing if you're going real heavy do about eight to ten reps.
a5yNwUSiYpA_12 If going real light, you want to to about ten to fifteen.
a5yNwUSiYpA_13 Again, the front squat you're going to concentrate a lot on the front part next to the knee cap to help develop those better.
a5yNwUSiYpA_14 And, that's how you perform the front squat.
a5yNwUSiYpA_2 This is in front of your body.
a5yNwUSiYpA_3 It's going to be laying on your shoulders.
a5yNwUSiYpA_4 Cross over your arms to keep the bar steady and to hold there.
a5yNwUSiYpA_5 Now, the front squat develops your teardrop.
a5yNwUSiYpA_6 That's what we call it at the gym.
a5yNwUSiYpA_7 Which, is the front part of your quads that's near the knee cap.
a5yNwUSiYpA_8 You want to go down with the bar, come up.
a5yNwUSiYpA_9 Again, just like the squat you want to push from the heels.
aUBqWgdXamE_1 I think we pretty much fixed our leaky little problem in here.
aUBqWgdXamE_2 So what we did was we took this old housing off and replaced our old leaky cartridge which is this one with a brand new one.
aUBqWgdXamE_3 I think we've probably solved our problems.
aUBqWgdXamE_4 At this point, is not going to be anymore leaks in this shower.
aUBqWgdXamE_5 Again, this is something that you can do at home.
aUBqWgdXamE_6 It is really not hard if you know the tricks and that is it for me today.
abzRFn8xngA_1 Normally what I would do if I was doing a spell for healing, is I would write out a petition.
abzRFn8xngA_2 And that would be almost like a prayer, saying what I intend to do and for whom I intend to do it.
abzRFn8xngA_3 Then I sometimes use a poppet, as I had mentioned before, and I wrap herbs around it.
abzRFn8xngA_4 Or if say they had a broken leg, I would concentrate the healing on the leg part.
abzRFn8xngA_5 Sometimes what I do is I'll take a photograph and put the photograph over the face, so that it actually looks like the person.
abzRFn8xngA_6 That's called sympathetic magic.
abzRFn8xngA_7 Where I'm not actually doing the magic on somebody, but I'm doing it on something instead.
abzRFn8xngA_8 And then I would place it on the pentacle, and I would continue with the spell saying what I would want for the healing and want for the person.
abzRFn8xngA_9 And of course, for the highest good of all, and that it harm none.
afDfb8xx09w_0 Now we're going to be talking about direction of the ball.
afDfb8xx09w_1 Basically, you have two directions that we're going to be talking about.
afDfb8xx09w_7 For forehand on the line, the same concept; you're going to be hitting the ball.
afDfb8xx09w_8 You're going to hit it just a little more behind.
ahJr2i50Qew_0 One thing, as you notice we don't have any three point lines here but, that wasn't always part of the game and this court was probably created during, sometime during that period, is the three point line.
ahJr2i50Qew_1 The three point line is actually, I talked about it earlier, is nineteen point nine for college and high school, and actually NBA, the NBA line is a little further out, it's at twenty three, nine, twenty three feet, nine inches.
ahJr2i50Qew_10 So, same shooting mechanics apply and there you have it, shooting the three point shot.
ahJr2i50Qew_2 So, whenever you're shooting same shooting mechanics apply.
ahJr2i50Qew_3 You want to take your, take your three point shot.
ahJr2i50Qew_4 I'm going to show you, I'm going to take, actually go across court here and show you exactly, what a round about what a three point shot would be, being is how we don't have, actually have a three point line on our court.
ahJr2i50Qew_5 So, check me out.
ahJr2i50Qew_6 When you're coming over here and you're shooting a three point shot, same shooting mechanics apply as a regular shot, no changes, you just might, down here you probably want to shoot a jump shot, unless you're strong enough to actually get it there with a set shot.
ahJr2i50Qew_7 So, when you're taking a, taking your three point shot, you want to make sure if you're playing outside, outdoors, you got to allot for the wind, that's the thing about playing outside.
ahJr2i50Qew_8 You've always got to allot for the wind.
ahJr2i50Qew_9 So, if you're taking this a little more distance, so when you're shooting the three point shot, you allot for the wind and there you go just like that, you take the shot.
angHQkCxQAc_1 It is important to maintain even tile courses each side of a gable and a roof wherever possible when using burrow trims.
angHQkCxQAc_10 In this instance a tapered plywood filler is added.
angHQkCxQAc_11 Fill in behind the first batten to allow the flat roofing membrane to form up and over the first batten without creating a water trap.
angHQkCxQAc_2 Uneven length trims cut at the peak create a visual problem.
angHQkCxQAc_3 It is of equal importance to have uniformed tile courses starting on each side of a hog valley where possible and practical.
angHQkCxQAc_4 Battens are installed 5 inches apart centered on the valley.
angHQkCxQAc_5 The batten spacer position sideways insures this accurate spacing.
angHQkCxQAc_6 As the valley flashing is gutter that sits down in the battens, you should frame the valleys first otherwise you would have to cut out eave prolongs to install the valley gutter.
angHQkCxQAc_7 When a valley transitions onto a lower roof you should end the valley framing just short of the lower tower coursing.
angHQkCxQAc_8 This will assist in transitioning the valley metal onto the lower tile.
angHQkCxQAc_9 A hog valley should be repitched to allow for adequate slope.
aoJDJktJkzw_0 Okay so our kimchi is pretty all mixed up now and when you are doing this at home you can really set this aside and let the pickling process happen for a good solid 1/2 hour to a hour and you can see now already the different of the texture of the kimchi.
aoJDJktJkzw_1 The cucumber is not stiff anymore, I mean it would still break and when you eat it, it has a nice crunch to it.
aoJDJktJkzw_2 So once it is ready all we have to do is revisit our rice which is now done is the rice cooker.
aoJDJktJkzw_3 Spoon some of it wooden paddles work really well and then serve up some of our kimchi.
aoJDJktJkzw_4 You can do it over the rice, the side of the rice, you can do it however you like and if you are really ambushes and you went to the Asian market and got some kimchi traditional kimchi.
aoJDJktJkzw_5 I'm going to put that in to and there you have your basic Korean meal vegetarian.
at8bAQq9jZY_1 One of the ways that I like to continue to create my sound is I use what is called a loop station.
at8bAQq9jZY_2 A loop station is basically a live recording its a XOR input or a quarter inch input depending on what type of model you have, that goes into the loop station and what you do is your press basically a peddle and it starts to record.
at8bAQq9jZY_3 When you press the peddle again it starts to play what you just recorded live back to you and back to the audience, and doing so you can create a mean sound with a lot of stuff layered on top of it.
at8bAQq9jZY_4 It's very creative way to show people what your about to help facilitate really what your music is about and creating a sound on stage.
at8bAQq9jZY_5 People really love it other musicians really dig it that's one way to broaden your musical horizons.
b-mHbL3d2ec_1 Just trim off the little root section and peel off that outer brown skin now to chop an onion you want to leave that little root section on there.
b-mHbL3d2ec_2 And when you cut down to your onion you only cut in here you start there you don't want to cut the onion from here because then the whole onion falls apart, if you start in this area and then slice down it will hold the onion together, see how the onion stays together.
b-mHbL3d2ec_3 And then you can just slice straight across and you get a nice medium cut onion and then you can just at that point cut up the rest the roots section.
b-mHbL3d2ec_4 Set that aside and then continue with our other onions just take off a little of that and peel it off, and by keeping the onion together like this it helps to cut down on the amount of onion vapors you get to because your not chop chopping everywhere with the onions going everywhere it stays compacted, and it's very quick to cut an onion like this.
b-mHbL3d2ec_5 Just continue that with all your onions now I'm going to show you how to peel and chop the garlic the easy way to get the skin off of the garlic is to take a flat a big knife a flat knife and just push with the palm of your hand to crush the garlic and the skin will fall right off.
b-mHbL3d2ec_6 Another way to crush the garlic is to take a steardy glass or jar and just give that a little whack that also crush the garlic and the peel just comes right off, I'm just going to rough chop this garlic and add it to our onions next we'll prep the leak.
b9zJhvHGxyk_0 My name is Kristy I'm working at the Curves in West Jordan Utah.
b9zJhvHGxyk_1 We are talking about weight loss tips.
b9zJhvHGxyk_10 And there's different ways to we support our ladies through exercising three times a week.
b9zJhvHGxyk_2 A really good way to lose weight sometimes is a support group.
b9zJhvHGxyk_3 Having friends to do it with you, family members or even joining the support group.
b9zJhvHGxyk_4 At curves we do offer nutrition classes, that is a group of ladies that are all the same goal, we meet once a week and we talk about suggestions for each other.
b9zJhvHGxyk_5 Tips on different salad dressings we've used that are lower fat that taste better.
b9zJhvHGxyk_6 Just to have a group of women doing it with you or even friends, or a spouse, someone that's there to support you that knows what you are going through.
b9zJhvHGxyk_7 And can help you through it and you can help them.
b9zJhvHGxyk_8 So you know if you want to find one you can bring a friend if not if you do go to a facility like curves or other facilities they do offer support groups where you can do it with a group of friends and you can all lose weight together.
b9zJhvHGxyk_9 Another part of our support group is we , with these ladies on the wall, they make a paper doll that resembles themselves and if they come to curves at least three times a week through the busy summer where a lot of people make it, find it hard to work out, they stay in our camp and we keep track of them call them let them know that we are, they haven't hit there three times a week that week.
bBHYQCDp_9A_0 When you're running a press, the defense is running a press, one thing that you want to learn how to do, is break that press.
bBHYQCDp_9A_1 Hi, I'm Travis and I'm about to teach you exactly how you can do that, when you're on the basketball court.
bBHYQCDp_9A_10 Once, that is the key to breaking the press.
bBHYQCDp_9A_11 The press, once a guard has the ball, in the middle of the court, the press is pretty much broken, then the, then the thing is finding someone to pass it to, and getting it down court.
bBHYQCDp_9A_12 So, try your best to get that person, whoever is going to have the ball, after it's inbound to get into the middle of the court, so that they have options on the right, and on their left.
bBHYQCDp_9A_13 Once that happens, there you have it, breaking the press.
bBHYQCDp_9A_2 Number one, when there is a press, a defensive press, what you want to make sure you do is, when you have the guy in, the person inbound the ball, you want to make sure that they have options.
bBHYQCDp_9A_3 Somewhere back here so that when they get in trouble, cause you don't want them out of bounds for five seconds, when they get in trouble, they can find someone to pass it to.
bBHYQCDp_9A_4 Usually, it'll be, you'll have two guards, you'll have your point guard, and your shooting guard back here.
bBHYQCDp_9A_5 And, what they'll do for each other, is they'll set screens, and when he or she smacks the ball, you'll have them split, to try to get open, once the ball is inbound and they get the ball, then that point guard or that shooting guard will take control of the game, and look for their options.
bBHYQCDp_9A_6 Now, the two guards are back here, you'll have, you may have the center all the way back or you may have the center somewhere closer to the top of the key, on the opposite top of the key.
bBHYQCDp_9A_7 But, you also want to have your forwards around half court, so that they have, so that your guards have options, if they get in trouble.
bBHYQCDp_9A_8 Now, you want to make sure that you pass the half court line within, within the time frame, the ten second time frame, but you want to also make sure that everybody is constantly moving cause you're breaking that press, there's pressure, there's going to be pressure that gets you, that's what the press is.
bBHYQCDp_9A_9 So, you want to have your offensive players down the court constantly moving, and constantly setting screens for each other, so they can get open.
bC_iD2Dwc1U_0 In this clip, we'd like to show you how to load your shotgun--your pump action shotgun.
bC_iD2Dwc1U_1 First, most important part to loading your pump shotgun is always make sure that your safety is applied.
bC_iD2Dwc1U_10 That's the way you load a pump action shotgun.
bC_iD2Dwc1U_2 In order to do that, you always want to make sure that the red dot isn't showing, or your safety is in safe position.
bC_iD2Dwc1U_3 Now, there are two different ways to load a pump action shotgun.
bC_iD2Dwc1U_4 The first way would be to take the shotgun, open the action, put a round in the chamber, and close the slide.
bC_iD2Dwc1U_5 And once you have the round in the chamber, at that point you could load the additional rounds in the magazine tube.
bC_iD2Dwc1U_6 The second way, and I'm going to show you this a little more clearly, if you take a closer look here, is to take the rounds, push down the loading gate right here, and then take your shotgun shells and push them in.
bC_iD2Dwc1U_7 You'll hear the spring that I'm pushing against as my finger goes in.
bC_iD2Dwc1U_8 Once that's loaded, you cannot fit another shotgun shell in there.
bC_iD2Dwc1U_9 Once your magazine tube is completely loaded, you'll again take the slide release, pull that back, and then load the shotgun.
bHdXYjk977I_0 Next we are going to talk about is, I am going to do a necklace and I am going to make a turquoise necklace since I have lots of turquoise here to choose from.
bHdXYjk977I_1 I am going to use a toggle clasp which has a circle and it also has an end piece here with a chain.
bHdXYjk977I_10 Let?s see what would look nice with the necklace and I think this one would look nice as a centerpiece.
bHdXYjk977I_11 That would look really good.
bHdXYjk977I_12 And what we will do is we will make a little bead go onto the end of this piece here to make it look like a little nice centerpiece.
bHdXYjk977I_13 There is the beads.
bHdXYjk977I_14 We will put it on the end here so that it will be a nice centerpiece for your necklace and this will be our design.
bHdXYjk977I_15 That will be the beginning of it.
bHdXYjk977I_2 So I am going to put this at the mark at eight so we can do a sixteen inch length necklace.
bHdXYjk977I_3 This is the type of bead I am going to use.
bHdXYjk977I_4 It?s called a flat disk.
bHdXYjk977I_5 There is also this type but I am going to use this one today and drape it on here so we know exactly if it?s going to be sixteen inches.
bHdXYjk977I_6 And most manufacturers when you buy your beads, they come in sixteen inch length.
bHdXYjk977I_7 Now because this is such a simple design here I thought maybe a little centerpiece would be nice.
bHdXYjk977I_8 So I was going through my large beads here and I was looking to see which one would match up nicely.
bHdXYjk977I_9 This one looks a little too blue here.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_0 A wrist control that we can use from a slashing attack.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_1 We're going to do it from the outside.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_10 I'm off the line of attack.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_11 The blade's far enough away from me that if it misses it misses.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_12 I'm here.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_13 I'm here.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_14 And then I control the hand.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_15 He wants to bring it back naturally.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_16 I'll flow with him.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_17 We don't want to get into a wrestling match.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_18 I don't want to fight him down here to keep it here.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_19 He want to bring it up?
bIUmw2DVW7Q_2 We want to create a protective barrier once again.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_20 That's fine.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_21 I'll go right with him.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_22 Boom.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_23 We want to control the motion and use his energy against him as much as possible.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_24 This motion is nice and small in an ever shrinking circle going gently past his forearm down into the ground.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_25 I don't want to heave him 40 yards away.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_26 I want him on the ground at my feet as quickly as possible.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_27 Here and down we go to the ground.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_28 And that is a good wrist control from a slashing attack.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_3_4_5 Create a diversionary framework. A Danny comes in here I want to follow that motion. Trap on top of the wrist right here and as he begins to pull back to get into position I want to follow him once again.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_6 A technique we have seen several times before.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_7 Because it's exceptionally effective.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_8 Which is why we're seeing it again.
bIUmw2DVW7Q_9 Here I create my protective line.
bR_iEPaf6eU_1 This video is about learning how to play the didgeridoo and I'd like to share a few secrets with you.
bR_iEPaf6eU_10 Some people can do it for a couple of hours at a time.
bR_iEPaf6eU_11 Start out with ten seconds, thirty seconds, a minute, two minutes, five minutes, turn it into a game, get your friends to buy one, turn it into a competition, and eventually play with multiple people.
bR_iEPaf6eU_2 As with any instrument, playing the didgeridoo requires practice.
bR_iEPaf6eU_3 And, yes, practice makes perfect.
bR_iEPaf6eU_4 The more you play the better you're going to get and the more fun you're going to have.
bR_iEPaf6eU_5 Get creative with it.
bR_iEPaf6eU_6 Have a good time.
bR_iEPaf6eU_7 It's relaxing to play this thing.
bR_iEPaf6eU_8 When I come home after a hard day at the TV station, I sit down in a closed room with my didgeridoo, for about a half an hour.
bR_iEPaf6eU_9 I can, sometimes, when my nose isn't plugged up circular breathe for up to hand an hour.
bUFsn9GQsCg_0 I have some very good news for you about the Feral cat.
bUFsn9GQsCg_1 The Los Angeles Police Department is now employing Feral cats, who otherwise would have been euphemized at shelters, to fight rats and mice at two police stations; one at the southeastern branch and the other, the central branch.
bUFsn9GQsCg_10 Very cute, and of course, people want to buy them, they're Turkish Angoras.
bUFsn9GQsCg_11 The idea is that this research may actually lead to the cure of a human disease.
bUFsn9GQsCg_12 Right now, it's just a very cute idea.
bUFsn9GQsCg_13 And you know what I say to that?
bUFsn9GQsCg_14 Meow, Meow, Meow.
bUFsn9GQsCg_2 And they report excellent success because once the mice and rats smell the presence of the cats, they flee.
bUFsn9GQsCg_3 The cats don't even have to chase them.
bUFsn9GQsCg_4 And it's said that at Parker Center, downtown LA, their main center, are now going to enjoy having the Feral cats drive out the rats there.
bUFsn9GQsCg_5 And you know, I think this should be carried out around the country.
bUFsn9GQsCg_6 Wherever there's a rat problem; whether it be police departments or elsewhere because the Feral cats do an excellent job and they would otherwise, I'm sorry to say, be euphemized.
bUFsn9GQsCg_7 Now, from South Korea, we have another case of cats that's very interesting.
bUFsn9GQsCg_8 They've just cloned glow-in-the-dark kitties.
bUFsn9GQsCg_9 Yes, they're giving them genes that make them glow in the dark when they're subjected to ultraviolet light.
bX0Zpf-rEgc_1 Tonight we're going to work and walk you through some advance bowling techniques so you can improve your game.
bX0Zpf-rEgc_2 From the stand point tonight we've covered a lot of information.
bX0Zpf-rEgc_3 We've talked basically about the stance, we've talked about how to move the ball through the stance, release position, spare shooting, how to change speed on the ball.
bX0Zpf-rEgc_4 We've given you a lot of information from a stand point, now it's time to take the information go out on the lanes and play with it.
bb1Z5dw4N-s_0 Now there are a few disadvantages to impromptu speaking.
bb1Z5dw4N-s_1 The first one that you need to be aware of is that your audience could get bored, alright?
bb1Z5dw4N-s_10 And those are some of the negatives that are not such great things about impromptu speaking, so just be aware of that when you're having to give an impromptu speech.
bb1Z5dw4N-s_11 Know that those are some of the pitfalls so that you might avoid them.
bb1Z5dw4N-s_2 And a lot of this has to do with structure, which I'm going to talk about in a minute, but you're thinking on your feet.
bb1Z5dw4N-s_3 You know the topic, but you have to, while you're speaking impromptu with no preparation, you have to keep your audience interested.
bb1Z5dw4N-s_4 You can't ramble on, you can't have random organizational patterns, you have to keep the audience with you.
bb1Z5dw4N-s_5 So that's something that you run the risk of is your audience not staying with you.
bb1Z5dw4N-s_6 Obviously your goal, your aim is to appear effective as a public speaker giving a well, thought-out speech.
bb1Z5dw4N-s_7 Well, you're at a disadvantage if you're giving an impromptu speech because you're not giving a well thought-out speech, you just met the topic.
bb1Z5dw4N-s_8 So you have to try and present a well thought-out speech, but you have to be careful because you have had no preparation time.
bb1Z5dw4N-s_9 You also, one of the negatives is that you can't really put a lot of attention on details -you haven't had time to research, you haven't had time to come up with the finesse and the finite things about your speech, so you're going to miss out on some of those details.
bbSKqkE4EBs_0 In this segment we're going to take a moment to talk about the benefits of Qigong breathing.
bbSKqkE4EBs_1 The essence of all Qigong exercises is in the exercise of the breath, and although there's wonderful energetic reasons on why we do the particular Qigong exercises we do, I like to talk more about the Western physiological reasons of why the belly breathing that we often times do is so beneficial.
bbSKqkE4EBs_10 Will also be helping with all that shack neck and shoulder pain that we often get from stress breathing, that we'll talk about in the next segment.
bbSKqkE4EBs_11 So remember, belly breathe is the way we're supposed to breathe.
bbSKqkE4EBs_2 One of the main reasons is the lymphatic system of our body.
bbSKqkE4EBs_3 The lymphatic system has two pumps.
bbSKqkE4EBs_4 One we get through exercise, muscle contraction, and the other one is through the action of the diaphragm, the muscle that we're supposed to use in respiration.
bbSKqkE4EBs_5 The dome shaped muscle that's here, right underneath our lungs, and then when we breathe in it comes down and when we breathe out it comes up.
bbSKqkE4EBs_6 That action of the diaphragm actually moves two thirds of the lymphatic fluids of our body, lymph being, I hate to say it, the gook of our body, or the waste products of many of our body's systems.
bbSKqkE4EBs_7 So, one of the best way we can do a cleanse or to feel better and more energized is just through breathing.
bbSKqkE4EBs_8 It has other benefits where in that it actually works towards helping regulate the PH of our blood, which can be beneficial for preventing osteoporosis, and so although the calcium in our bones is the primary way, the breathing is the second most common way for our body to treat that.
bbSKqkE4EBs_9 So, we can actually have benefits of preventing osteoporosis just by breathing properly.
bcNtUYh3GNs_0 I'm Veronyka Bass from Veronyka's Color Salon and Day Spa.
bcNtUYh3GNs_2 Now we're going to have her lean back, get comfortable.
bcNtUYh3GNs_3 And this is where we're going to use the warm water.
bcNtUYh3GNs_4 More on the warm side than not hot or cold.
bcNtUYh3GNs_5 So we're going to get ready to shampoo her, and at the very end of a shampoo, it's nice to give it a cold rinse, so it seals the cuticle.
bcNtUYh3GNs_6 Alot of people don't realize that.
bcNtUYh3GNs_7 It's going to be a little bit of a cold shower, but it seals the cuticle.
bcNtUYh3GNs_8 Now I'm getting ready to use our shampoo to bring the pH balance down.
bcNtUYh3GNs_9 This will stop the total continuation of processing.
bjvIIdYWc-k_1 Right now we are going to discuss choosing the right paint for your project.
bjvIIdYWc-k_2 What I have here in my hand is a paint wheel.
bjvIIdYWc-k_3 It gives the different colors that independent stores would offer.
bjvIIdYWc-k_4 So you can have specific selections to choose from.
bjvIIdYWc-k_5 Depending upon the application you are going to either want to get a flat, a eggshell, a satin, gloss, semi-gloss, all that can be done regardless of your color chooses.
bjvIIdYWc-k_6 Personally I would put a gloss or a semi-gloss on your doors and eggshells or a satin on your walls.
bjvIIdYWc-k_7 You can use flat to go along your ceilings or you can use a satin finish for that as well.
bjvIIdYWc-k_8 The reason for this for the different changes is to bring out the different colors, the different textures and also the ability and clean ability.
bjvIIdYWc-k_9 A higher gloss paint is going to give you a more cleanable surface or as a flat paint is not easily as clean.
bpOKSl0oIIw_1 Today we're going to be learning how to play Portal, a game by Valve Software.
bpOKSl0oIIw_10 The sort of toxic goo that you wouldn't want to find yourself in.
bpOKSl0oIIw_11 So we want to avoid hitting the floor of test chamber 08 at all costs.
bpOKSl0oIIw_12 We look over here on our left, we've got a power ball dispenser and an orange portal and a power conduit.
bpOKSl0oIIw_13 What we need to do is find a way to get the power ball over to the conduit and that will activate this elevator and let us get to the exit.
bpOKSl0oIIw_14 But we need to be careful because, if we come out of this orange portal and get hit by the power ball, we will die.
bpOKSl0oIIw_15 So we need to find a different way of doing things.
bpOKSl0oIIw_2 A company with which I have no affiliation.
bpOKSl0oIIw_3 All right!
bpOKSl0oIIw_4 Here we are in test chamber 08.
bpOKSl0oIIw_5 We've got some new icons here now.
bpOKSl0oIIw_6 We've got the old familiar power ball death, power ball power conduit, and now it looks like we've got some other ones.
bpOKSl0oIIw_7 The risk of drowning and don't drink the water.
bpOKSl0oIIw_8 So we look here in test chamber 08.
bpOKSl0oIIw_9 We can see that the floor is actually sort of toxic goo.
cDJuwtDYaSg_0 Alright the drink that we are about to make is a Black and Tan.
cDJuwtDYaSg_1 Now there's a lot of debate on what two beers are supposed to be used for a black and tan.
cDJuwtDYaSg_10 So anytime you want to spice up your Guinness a little bit, and you don't feel like having just a Bask, make yourself a Black and Tan, a mixture of both.
cDJuwtDYaSg_11 Bottoms up.
cDJuwtDYaSg_2 But if you ask most people they'll tell you that Guinness and Bask Ale.
cDJuwtDYaSg_3 First thing we're going to do is we're going to take a pint glass and start by pouring in your Bask, half way.
cDJuwtDYaSg_4 And we're going to fill it the rest of the way with Guinness.
cDJuwtDYaSg_5 And the Guinness is darker.
cDJuwtDYaSg_6 You will see the difference in the top and the bottom.
cDJuwtDYaSg_7 It should have a nice distinction between that and let's get a close up so you can see.
cDJuwtDYaSg_8 And the top should be a little bit darker than the bottom.
cDJuwtDYaSg_9 And that's a Black and Tan.
cHFW_U9e4sM_0 The next point you're going to use for the lower legs especially is inner courtyard or stomach 44.
cHFW_U9e4sM_1 And this one is really easy to find, it's literally between the second and third toe.
cHFW_U9e4sM_2 So you're just going to rub in between the toes.
cHFW_U9e4sM_3 Just run your finger in there, massage in between the toes and this is another good one for dispersing pain, relaxing the muscles and dogs like to generally have their feet massaged by their owners, they don't like them touched by the vets much, but quite often they'll let the owners do just about anything.
cHFW_U9e4sM_4 You can do a full foot massage on them if you like.
cHFW_U9e4sM_5 There's good acupressure points in between the other toes as well, but this one specifically for muscle stiffness and pain in the back limbs.
cHFW_U9e4sM_6 So you'll want to work that one and again do both sides because quite often if this knee is hurting he's compensating by using this leg.
cHFW_U9e4sM_7 So you're causing discomfort and stiffness in both legs.
cHFW_U9e4sM_8 You want to work that point.
cHFW_U9e4sM_9 Again this is a massage, just rubbing that muscle between your fingers, the tissues between your fingers and really rub that fairly hard, feel that skin move around so that you know that you're getting some real movement in the area.
cOCnNdL5fwI_1 I'm here to discuss short curly locks with you.
cOCnNdL5fwI_10 Now Heather has very fine hair and this goes to extra hot.
cOCnNdL5fwI_11 She's not going to need something extra hot in order to go on her hair so you can actually bring it down to maybe your highs speed or high temperature.
cOCnNdL5fwI_12 The courser your hair is, the hotter the most you would likely need your thermal styling tool to be in order to really work on your hair.
cOCnNdL5fwI_13 Now if I grab this, the softer the curl is the better it would be especially you can see when they're going to fall.
cOCnNdL5fwI_14 So you can see that the curl is very tight, very wiggly.
cOCnNdL5fwI_15 That is what you want when you're working with shorter hair especially fine and straight hair.
cOCnNdL5fwI_16 It's going to help achieve your style and it's going to help you maintain your movement maintaining your curl and also add some volume.
cOCnNdL5fwI_2 The tools that you're going to want to use to create a curl can consist of thermal styling tools which is ultimately your curling iron.
cOCnNdL5fwI_3 Curling irons come in various diameters they come very small, 1/2" they go to 3/4", the 1" 1 1/2" and then the 2".
cOCnNdL5fwI_4 The longer the larger the diameter the looser the weight is going to be.
cOCnNdL5fwI_5 Now when somebody like Heather's hair, you also must take into consideration the length of her hair.
cOCnNdL5fwI_6 If I was to use this on this section, it would only do one turn, it would be very very loose and it would literally use something like this on shorter hair just to kind to give it a little bevel around the face.
cOCnNdL5fwI_7 Just to really kind to get the hair to either go under or flip out, the smaller diameter will work best on her hair.
cOCnNdL5fwI_8 Another great benefit with curling irons such as this one is does have a heat adjustment on it.
cOCnNdL5fwI_9 The heat adjustment will allow for you to adjust the heat to order to cater to your hair.
cS44xaCZy7A_0 We're now going to start lunging the horse.
cS44xaCZy7A_1 You'll notice that I still have the chain over my horse’s nose.
cS44xaCZy7A_2 This just gives me a little bit more control.
cS44xaCZy7A_3 I also have put on a pair of gloves and this is a really important thing to do to protect your hands from getting burned if your horse decides he doesn't want to behave and stay on the circle.
cS44xaCZy7A_4 It also lets you grip the lunge line a little bit better.
cS44xaCZy7A_5 I also have a lunge whip and this is an important tool in order for us to communicate that we want our horse to go forward and we're also in an enclosed arena.
cS44xaCZy7A_6 So that if something does go wrong he can't get out.
cS44xaCZy7A_7 So I'm going to start by just letting him come into a small circle around me.
cYAlaOtYJw8_0 The next trick we are going to be doing is called a Grind Transfer.
cYAlaOtYJw8_1 This is a trick that is based off grinding.
cYAlaOtYJw8_10 But any way you do it you are transferring the grind from one hand to the next.
cYAlaOtYJw8_11 There's lots of variations.
cYAlaOtYJw8_12 I am going to show you my favorite which is the one from the arm to the arm.
cYAlaOtYJw8_13 So what you want to do.
cYAlaOtYJw8_14 You start with your non throw hand out and just practice landing it and grinding it on there.
cYAlaOtYJw8_15 Just get it to sit there for a couple of seconds, get the feel for it.
cYAlaOtYJw8_16 Eventually what you want to do is grind up to your hand and this is when you bring your other hand in to intercept it.
cYAlaOtYJw8_17 So, try this again.
cYAlaOtYJw8_18 So the yo-yo lands on your non throw hand, it comes up and this when you bring your other hand in.
cYAlaOtYJw8_19 Shoots straight across.
cYAlaOtYJw8_2 Basically you're moving from one part of your body to another.
cYAlaOtYJw8_20 I'm going to show you in real time what this looks like again.
cYAlaOtYJw8_21 Again, you're going to need a really strong throw, it's really important that you have a really strong throw when you're doing this.
cYAlaOtYJw8_22 The yo-yo needs to keep up the momentum from one hand to the next.
cYAlaOtYJw8_23 You should already have good grinding skills from the first grinding video we did were we just went over the basic grind.
cYAlaOtYJw8_24 Practice that, practice controlling it up your arm, get that really strong and good.
cYAlaOtYJw8_25 It's really important that you can do that well if you want to be able to transfer it from one arm to the next.
cYAlaOtYJw8_26 Practice that and you'll be able to transfer your grinds.
cYAlaOtYJw8_3 Transferring the yo-yo as it's grinding from one part to the other.
cYAlaOtYJw8_4 Let me show you what it looks like.
cYAlaOtYJw8_5 It goes from one arm to the other.
cYAlaOtYJw8_6 I think this a really smooth looking trick it shows that you have a lot of control over the yo-yo.
cYAlaOtYJw8_7 It's just going from one arm to the next.
cYAlaOtYJw8_8 There is other variations you can do from it.
cYAlaOtYJw8_9 Some people will land it in their palm and shoot it across.

cw5evdziBB4_0 Hello welcome back!
cw5evdziBB4_1 In this segment we're going to be discussing how to make the client comfortable on the massage table.
cw5evdziBB4_10 There we go, are you comfortable?
cw5evdziBB4_11 I am, great!
cw5evdziBB4_12 Can you lift your knees for me please?
cw5evdziBB4_13 Do you have any aches or pains?
cw5evdziBB4_14 A little on the hip.
cw5evdziBB4_15 On the hip?
cw5evdziBB4_16 Have you had a massage before?
cw5evdziBB4_17 No.
cw5evdziBB4_18 No, okay great!
cw5evdziBB4_19 Is there any part of you body that you would like special attention paid to?
cw5evdziBB4_2 So in this case we're working with a massage table, other individuals if they're in chair or in a bed, you'll deal with that as it presents itself to you.
cw5evdziBB4_20 A lot of stress right now, so I think just whatever that will help me relax.
cw5evdziBB4_21 Great, we can do that.
cw5evdziBB4_22 So after we find out what the needs are of our client and make sure your client is comfortable, then we're set to move on to the next segment.
cw5evdziBB4_3 So Molinia do you care to demonstrate with me?
cw5evdziBB4_4 I'm going to first have you sit up, great!
cw5evdziBB4_5 So when the individual gets on the table, first we have them sit on the side.
cw5evdziBB4_6 Can you swing your legs around?
cw5evdziBB4_7 There you go!
cw5evdziBB4_8 So they first get on the table like this and then we have them swing their legs onto the table, great!
cw5evdziBB4_9 Then, slowly lower yourself supporting her back and her head.
cwLJfXFf9ks_0 The principles of Aikido can be applied to daily life in many different situations.
cwLJfXFf9ks_1 It can be applied in your family with your spouse, with your kids.
cwLJfXFf9ks_10 In that, that last technique, as Phil comes in and attacks we enter and we face the same direction.
cwLJfXFf9ks_11 We can see exactly what they are seeing.
cwLJfXFf9ks_12 We can get a little different perspective.
cwLJfXFf9ks_13 If we think that we need to deal with the situation a little bit more directly we can just go off the attack immediately.
cwLJfXFf9ks_14 As he attacks just turn and go right in.
cwLJfXFf9ks_15 Everything is blending and harmonizing.
cwLJfXFf9ks_16 Some can be a little more direct.
cwLJfXFf9ks_17 Others can just not connect with that energy.
cwLJfXFf9ks_18 If it is negative energy or anger or frustration you don't need to deal with it.
cwLJfXFf9ks_19 There are many different ways as you can see to deal with each individual situation and Aikido principles will help you deal with that in daily life.
cwLJfXFf9ks_2 It can be applied at work with an irate boss or co-worker.
cwLJfXFf9ks_3 It could be an upset driver.
cwLJfXFf9ks_4 It could be somebody with road rage.
cwLJfXFf9ks_5 We are going to demonstrate a couple of different techniques to emphasize the principles and why don't we just take a peek.
cwLJfXFf9ks_6 For example if there is somebody coming at you with road rage it is probably best not to block, not to stop them with your car but just to let them go right by and with Aikido it looks something like this.
cwLJfXFf9ks_7 I'll show you.
cwLJfXFf9ks_8 So that is one way, you can just let them go right by.
cwLJfXFf9ks_9 If you need to deal with the situation a little bit more it might look something like this.
cxW8HFCWjlQ_1 This yogurt is a Bulgarian yogurt that is non fat so it really healthy, it is a little more on the sour side as far as yogurts go and most middle eastern yogurt is kind of sour.
cxW8HFCWjlQ_10 I will definitely recommend getting this kind of yogurt so so good.
cxW8HFCWjlQ_11 Yogurt in the middle east is kind of like ketchup here in the United States so and that is it for the yogurt part of the hummus.
cxW8HFCWjlQ_2 I would recommend using the middle eastern yogurt if you can on the hummus because this taste more better then the regular yogurt that you get in HEB.
cxW8HFCWjlQ_3 You can usually find this at HEB but if cant go to your middle eastern store and they would have yogurt and you just want to add about 2 tablespoons to your hummus.
cxW8HFCWjlQ_4 Not only this gives it a great flavor but it also makes the hummus a little liquidly and not as chunky as it would be if it didn't have this.
cxW8HFCWjlQ_5 A lot of people use olive oil in there hummus to make it a lot thinner then what it usually is because when you grind up all these garbanzo beans it comes out kind chunky.
cxW8HFCWjlQ_6 It's a lot better to get it more puree that way it has a better texture to it.
cxW8HFCWjlQ_7 This yogurt as I said is non fat it also comes in a version that is not non fat that you can pick which ever one you like but it is definitely very good yogurt.
cxW8HFCWjlQ_8 This one right here is my favorite and I think it is whitemountainfoods.
cxW8HFCWjlQ_9 com you can go and order this.
dIIMHOX5AD8_0 Now that we've covered walking properly, lets work on focusing on One Point, so we're actually moving up the body as we go.
dIIMHOX5AD8_1 One Point, if you could look, the center of mass, is going to be bellybutton, anywhere from 2 to 3 inches down, depending, so right about where this belt is.
dIIMHOX5AD8_10 And we will continue on this subject, shortly thereafter.
dIIMHOX5AD8_2 Now One Point is the principal of dynamic motion without actual visible motion taking place.
dIIMHOX5AD8_3 One way of thinking of it is that, if you have somebody, it's tensile strength.
dIIMHOX5AD8_4 And if you have somebody grab onto your arm, they're out to be a living, breathing connection, that, yes they're, it feels very strong, it feels like a fire hose.
dIIMHOX5AD8_5 A fire hose is almost impossible to bend when water is flowing through it.
dIIMHOX5AD8_6 It's a living entity, and therefore, One Point is very much the same thing, it is a living entity.
dIIMHOX5AD8_7 And you are looking for that constant relaxed, natural power of tensile strength.
dIIMHOX5AD8_8 It's not muscular by any means, and it is certainly not structural, but there is, well I shouldn't say that, because there is an aspect of structural to it.
dIIMHOX5AD8_9 With correct structure, and correct relaxation, you build on tensile strength.
dKumOzqVk3M_0 Hello, this is JB, I'm with Austin Homebrew Supply in Austin, Texas.
dKumOzqVk3M_1 Talking to you today about equipment and process and ingredients that go into making your own beer at your own home.
dKumOzqVk3M_10 Subsequently it's food grade.
dKumOzqVk3M_11 In other words, there's no way that any kind of oil and or internal petroleums or lubricants can contact the beer or wine that you're moving through here.
dKumOzqVk3M_12 So.
dKumOzqVk3M_13 These guys are called food grade pumps.
dKumOzqVk3M_14 They're made by a company called March, and these guys do a great job of moving hot, boiling wort or beer from point A to point B without you having to pick up big kettles full of hot broiling liquid.
dKumOzqVk3M_15 So.
dKumOzqVk3M_16 Food grade pumps really come in handy when you're brewing.
dKumOzqVk3M_2 Or wine, or cider, or socky.
dKumOzqVk3M_3 You got a lot of different things you can make here.
dKumOzqVk3M_4 So.
dKumOzqVk3M_5 One of the things you want to do at the end of, or during the process of either making beer, especially beer making, or even wine, is you need to rack or transfer, we had some strange terminology here, but, racking means to transfer from point A to point B.
dKumOzqVk3M_6 So, especially in beer making a lot of time you're moving hot liquids from one point to another, especially if you want to take a hot liquid from a low point and take it to a higher point.
dKumOzqVk3M_7 Well it's going to be a real difficult to pick up a boiling hot container of liquid and move it.
dKumOzqVk3M_8 So, so, that being said, we carry food grade pumps that, the reason they're food grade is, there's a space between where the motor hosing is, the actual pump drive with the magnetic drive between, so.
dKumOzqVk3M_9 There's a complete difference between the motor, and where the actual liquid comes through.
dQJyDM9pKR8_0 Effleurage is a massage stroke that basically just stroking the horse.
dQJyDM9pKR8_1 You can do it either with your hands, with your fingers closed and just stroking down the side of the horse, keeping one hand on the horse all the time while you are doing it.
dQJyDM9pKR8_2 Or you can have your fingers more open in sort of a combed shape, the stroking down the side of the horse starting at the poll and working all the way back.
dQJyDM9pKR8_3 That's actually a fairly safe stroke to use, either form of effleurage, horse's most likely you know almost always enjoy it.
dQJyDM9pKR8_4 They don't find it to be too invasive, it's not going to be uncomfortable for them and the, unless you are being careless it's a fairly safe stroke to be using.
dQJyDM9pKR8_5 So again I'm talking about having your hands either with your fingers open like this and just kind of combing on the horse or having your fingers closed and stroking down the sides of the horse.
dQJyDM9pKR8_6 And just petting them.
dQJyDM9pKR8_7 It's a nice gentle stroke, it helps them to relax.
dWOtJxrH_Ww_0 I'm Tim Gipson, and I'm going to talk to you about trouble shooting your refrigerator.
dWOtJxrH_Ww_1 Now, if you don't have any power at all to your refrigerator, first few things you want to check is you want to check and make sure that the breaker is not tripped in your main breaker box.
dWOtJxrH_Ww_10 Recommended settings are anywhere from about 34 degrees to 38 degrees, depending on really how cold you like to keep some of your products, particularly dairy products.
dWOtJxrH_Ww_11 Then the other side here, on the freezer side, some of the common things you can run in to is whether your ice maker is not distributing ice properly, or your water's not coming out.
dWOtJxrH_Ww_12 Now if water's not coming out, most of these are equipped with a filter, so in this case, this one tells you when it's time to start thinking about ordering a filter, and it tells you when to replace it.
dWOtJxrH_Ww_13 On the ice, occasionally, you may just need to come in here, where these are frost free freezers, this can actually warm up, or some of your ice melts together, and the agitating arm can actually get stuck.
dWOtJxrH_Ww_14 So you want to come in here and break up your ice occasionally.
dWOtJxrH_Ww_15 So I'm Tim Gipson, and that's some trouble shooting tips for your refrigerator.
dWOtJxrH_Ww_2 So you want to locate where that is, and you want to check the breaker and make sure it is reset.
dWOtJxrH_Ww_3 If it is popped, you want to make sure you reset it to the on position.
dWOtJxrH_Ww_4 The next thing would be to check the power chord behind the refrigerator and make sure it hasn't come loose from the outlet.
dWOtJxrH_Ww_5 So that's basically on the power.
dWOtJxrH_Ww_6 Now, if you still are not, do not have power, you may need to consult a professional repair service at that point, because there could be something internal to the refrigerator.
dWOtJxrH_Ww_7 Now this particular refrigerator, it has all electronic controls, so it has its own sensors, which really tell you what's going on.
dWOtJxrH_Ww_8 This particular model, up here, if you have some food that may not be staying cool enough, you might check your temperature controls.
dWOtJxrH_Ww_9 This particular model actually tells you what the degrees are set to.
d_0dt3VdYCo_0 In tennis, a lot of times you're going to get shots that aren't standardized, that you're not really prepared for unless you play a lot.
d_0dt3VdYCo_1 And the half volley is one of those shots.
d_0dt3VdYCo_10 He's just going to block it forward as he comes to the net.
d_0dt3VdYCo_11 So it's just a way of taking a ball.
d_0dt3VdYCo_12 You're not really doing much with it.
d_0dt3VdYCo_13 You're just blocking it forward.
d_0dt3VdYCo_14 Now, John McEnroe was a master of this shot.
d_0dt3VdYCo_15 But you have to have it.
d_0dt3VdYCo_16 It's very apropos in doubles that you're able to block the ball back, because if they volley it at your feet, you've just got to be able to block it right back.
d_0dt3VdYCo_17 So what you want to do is just use a whole basket of balls.
d_0dt3VdYCo_18 See how many in a row you can make.
d_0dt3VdYCo_19 See how many out of 50 you can make, and as the number of balls in practice improves, your results on the court are also going to improve.
d_0dt3VdYCo_2 So here's a drill that helps you get the half volley.
d_0dt3VdYCo_3 You can use a wall, which is great.
d_0dt3VdYCo_4 But, in this case, your practice partner, in this case it will be me, I'll be throwing the ball to Darren.
d_0dt3VdYCo_5 So, imagine that you've hit a nice shot, you're coming to the net, or you've hit a nice serve, you're coming to the net, and your opponent hits a ball that drops by your feet.
d_0dt3VdYCo_6 It bounces up, and you've got to just block it forward.
d_0dt3VdYCo_7 So that's what this drill is.
d_0dt3VdYCo_8 So Darren is going to demonstrate.
d_0dt3VdYCo_9 I'm going to throw it by his feet.
d_V_K6ziiNA_0 Knots have a long and varied history throughout time, and today I'm going to show you how to make one of the great ones.
d_V_K6ziiNA_1 My name is Robert Segundo, and I'm going to teach you how to make a clove hitch.
d_V_K6ziiNA_10 I mean, you can hold things with it.
d_V_K6ziiNA_11 You can't put a whole lot of tension on it,because it will slip through.
d_V_K6ziiNA_12 But it's good enough if you're just trying to hold some items down.
d_V_K6ziiNA_13 Let's do that one more time.
d_V_K6ziiNA_14 Let's pull this up...and out, like so.
d_V_K6ziiNA_15 Once again, we'll go over, we'll go under, over our standing end.
d_V_K6ziiNA_16 And we'll go over like so, back under, and through the loop we've created, and there it is.
d_V_K6ziiNA_17 There's our clove hitch.
d_V_K6ziiNA_18 My name is Robert Segundo, and enjoy tying knots.
d_V_K6ziiNA_2 Now a hitch, technically, isn't a knot, but it falls in the same category of kind of the macrame style.
d_V_K6ziiNA_3 So what we're going to do is, we're going to look down to our table here, and we can see I have my rod, here, that I'm going to attach my line to.
d_V_K6ziiNA_4 What I'm going to do is, I'm going to take my line initially, I'm going to roll it up and over, and then bring it under, like so.
d_V_K6ziiNA_5 Then it's going to go over the standing end that was there, and I'm going to take my working end back up and over.
d_V_K6ziiNA_6 And it's going to come under, and then back through the loop, like so.
d_V_K6ziiNA_7 There you go.
d_V_K6ziiNA_8 This is basically two half-hitches put together, and this is just a clove hitch.
d_V_K6ziiNA_9 And it's really tight.
eLv9Uhs89IQ_0_1 Hello, have you ever wondered how to prepare for a divorce? Well, I'm Dr. Felicia and I'd like to share a few tips with you.
eLv9Uhs89IQ_10 If you have children, you need to prepare, if you're going to have to move and assign them into new schools, get them registered.
eLv9Uhs89IQ_11 You may need to actually enlist family support for child care.
eLv9Uhs89IQ_12 You may need to get all kinds of clothing sorted out, in terms of who keeps what, belongings and personal belongings in the house, who keeps what.
eLv9Uhs89IQ_13 And if you are the caretaker of the children, you obviously need more than the party who's going to leave without the children.
eLv9Uhs89IQ_14 In either case, I wish you good luck.
eLv9Uhs89IQ_15 And remember it's how to prepare and survive for divorce is never easy.
eLv9Uhs89IQ_16 Good luck, Dr. Felicia, goodbye.
eLv9Uhs89IQ_2 Preparing for divorce is a very scary and frightening prospect, whether you're the male or the female in the relationship.
eLv9Uhs89IQ_3 One of the things you want to consider, especially if you're the female is that for instance today, most court jurisdictions only allow about three years alimony for rehabilitation.
eLv9Uhs89IQ_4 So, if the partner wanted to go back to school and be career-oriented, that's give them three years time in preparation.
eLv9Uhs89IQ_5 So, that's a pretty frightening prospect in itself.
eLv9Uhs89IQ_6 If you already had a career and you're in a working world, it's not as quite as frightening, but, chances are your assets are pretty well divided, and you're going to need to start to secure some new aspects for yourself.
eLv9Uhs89IQ_7 You want to decide if keeping the house is in your best interest or perhaps the expenses to run the house are just so expensive, it's not worth it.
eLv9Uhs89IQ_8 You may wish to downsize and put yourself into a situation where you can readily afford it on one person's pay.
eLv9Uhs89IQ_9 The other thing that you want to prepare for is housing.
eRiOhdeskNE_0 Alright we've just completed our two flowers.
eRiOhdeskNE_1 They've been clear embossed and then they've been embossed with glassy glaze and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a center for each of these flower.
eRiOhdeskNE_10 And just push the chipboard back a little bit if you don't have enough room.
eRiOhdeskNE_11 Alright now we're ready to give this another squeeze and finish that eyelet.
eRiOhdeskNE_12 Alright.
eRiOhdeskNE_13 And then the little one same thing.
eRiOhdeskNE_14 Alright now we want to hang this off the wreath so I'm going to need a smaller hole.
eRiOhdeskNE_15 I need a 3/16th so I'm going to just poke a hole at the tip of the leaf there and at the tip of the leaf there.
eRiOhdeskNE_16 And I'm going to be using some natural hemp twine to tie this on to my wreath.
eRiOhdeskNE_17 I chose the natural hemp twine because the wreath that I've chosen is the grapevine wreath and you can see I've embossed and glassy glazed a variety of flowers.
eRiOhdeskNE_18 I've attached them with the hemp twine and then I've tied it altogether with the 5/8th wide certainly Sally or gross grain ribbon to make a beautiful wreath that your Mom will be proud to hang on her front door.
eRiOhdeskNE_2 And I'm using the jumbo eyelets in my cropodile and I'm just going to go ahead to the middle of that flower using the 3/16th punch.
eRiOhdeskNE_3 Punch it out, and do the same thing with the smaller flower.
eRiOhdeskNE_4 Punch that out.
eRiOhdeskNE_5 And I'm going to be using the pewter eyelets.
eRiOhdeskNE_6 And I'm just going to push down.
eRiOhdeskNE_7 And sometimes if you're not lined up quite right if you lay it on its front you can push it down a little bit better.
eRiOhdeskNE_8 There's one.
eRiOhdeskNE_9 And now the second one.
eY32ru3Nstc_0 I'm going to show you how to make a Razberi Sunsplash, a wonderfully fruity cocktail.
eY32ru3Nstc_1 We are going to start off with our ice.
eY32ru3Nstc_10 Then, we're going to add in two splashes of grenadine.
eY32ru3Nstc_11 Uno, dos, like so.
eY32ru3Nstc_12 And, about an ounce of orange juice, yum.
eY32ru3Nstc_13 And then we're going to fill it the rest of the way with pineapple juice.
eY32ru3Nstc_14 So, this is going to be so wonderfully tropical.
eY32ru3Nstc_15 Hence, the name Sunsplash.
eY32ru3Nstc_16 Go ahead and shake it up.
eY32ru3Nstc_17 And if you have a hurricane glass, great.
eY32ru3Nstc_18 If not, you can also serve this in a highball glass.
eY32ru3Nstc_19 Garnish it with a cherry, and there you have it, Razberi Sunsplash.
eY32ru3Nstc_2 Just like so.
eY32ru3Nstc_20 Cheers.
eY32ru3Nstc_3 Pour that into your glass, and then we're going to add to that, three fourths of an ounce of coconut rum, any brand will do, so choose your favorite.
eY32ru3Nstc_4 You're the one drinking it, and I want you to like it.
eY32ru3Nstc_5 We're then going to add three-fourths of an ounce of raspberry liqueur.
eY32ru3Nstc_6 Just like so.
eY32ru3Nstc_7 That's going to give it a wonderful fruity flavor.
eY32ru3Nstc_8 As is our peachtree schnapps.
eY32ru3Nstc_9 Also, three-fourths of an ounce, so equal parts.
eYzmPu5FLpU_0 We are back and we are going to talk about the music alphabet.
eYzmPu5FLpU_1 I'm sure you all know the English alphabet, it is twenty-six letters you have not forgotten that.
eYzmPu5FLpU_10 You might have notice I sometimes move only one fret from open to the first fret, sometimes I move two frets from C to D and F to G .
eYzmPu5FLpU_11 I want you to think of two frets as a whole step it is good terminology.
eYzmPu5FLpU_12 Remember whole steps is two frets and a half step is one fret open to one fret.
eYzmPu5FLpU_13 This would be important later okay.
eYzmPu5FLpU_14 So we have the first three strings G and then ABCDEFG.
eYzmPu5FLpU_15 Okay so do that for about a thousand times and then we would come back and we will learn some techniques with the left hand and we would start playing some stuff and having some fun okay.
eYzmPu5FLpU_2 The music alphabet is much easier, there is only seven letters ABCDEFG.
eYzmPu5FLpU_3 I'm glad I got that right that would have been embarrassing.
eYzmPu5FLpU_4 Anyway after G we start over on A and this is important so that we can read music, we can understand music, and we can write music it is important to understand that.
eYzmPu5FLpU_5 Let me show you the first string.
eYzmPu5FLpU_6 I told you earlier it was the E string after E we are going to play the F and the G that is the first two notes we are going to play EF and G. We are going to go ahead and move on to the second and third string and it would take some time if this is your first time to get use to these notes.
eYzmPu5FLpU_7 The second string is a B string followed by a C and a D. BCD.
eYzmPu5FLpU_8 First string is a G followed by a A G and A.
eYzmPu5FLpU_9 So if I start on this A and climb up you can see the alphabet ABCDEFG, ABCDEFG okay.
eahjYz2685g_0 Now another important thing for you to remember, and this is going to be a little difficult, because we all tend to like to please people, we all tend to like accolades and praise.
eahjYz2685g_1 But it's very important that you remember everyone does not have to love your speech.
eahjYz2685g_10 Well, the last time I did that speech everybody hated it.
eahjYz2685g_11 Or, everybody said I was bad.
eahjYz2685g_12 Past failures of people not liking your speech, or not liking you, have nothing to do with present and future presentations.
eahjYz2685g_13 Maybe that happened before.
eahjYz2685g_14 Ok, so what?
eahjYz2685g_15 Move on.
eahjYz2685g_16 It won't happen this time just because it happened last time.
eahjYz2685g_2 Everyone does not have to love you.
eahjYz2685g_3 I found that out many, many years ago as a college professor when I used to try to please all of my students.
eahjYz2685g_4 And invariably I would have one, or maybe two, a semester, that just, they just didn't like me.
eahjYz2685g_5 It didn't matter what I did, they didn't like me.
eahjYz2685g_6 And that was ok.
eahjYz2685g_7 It's ok if one or two people disagree with your speech.
eahjYz2685g_8 It's ok if one or two or three people don't like you.
eahjYz2685g_9 You have to continue to allow that to be ok. You also have to take a look at past failures as a speaker.
f-mvu_dZvjg_1 A big misconception is that if your dog's tale is waging, is that he's happy.
f-mvu_dZvjg_10 So, it's ok for dogs to look and be curious, but if they get that intense obssessive stare, then it's going to be threatened.
f-mvu_dZvjg_2 Alot of dogs wag their tales when they are ready to attack as well, so the big thing to notice is where your dog's tail is.
f-mvu_dZvjg_3 Like if his tail is tucked, then he's afraid and you should not be petting him at that time and you should not be petting him at that time.
f-mvu_dZvjg_4 You never pet a dog when he is afraid, because that will make him more afraid.
f-mvu_dZvjg_5 If it is laying loosey like this, this is just normal.
f-mvu_dZvjg_6 When he's waging his tail and it's out here in the middle, that means he's happy, that's a normal state of mind.
f-mvu_dZvjg_7 When the tail starts to go up and it starts to wag like this, your dog is probably in a more aggressive state of mind.
f-mvu_dZvjg_8 Another thing about dogs, when you're walking them, you'll see their ears perk up, if their ears perk up, that's them paying more attention.
f-mvu_dZvjg_9 But you can see a lot of times that they will get this intense stare when they are fixating on something and when they are fixating on something, that's when you need to correct them because that's them being obsessed with that object whether it be a person, or another dog, or anything like that.
f5EGPzGSCJs_0 Today we're going to talk about how to diagnose an ailment of your fish.
f5EGPzGSCJs_1 Part of keeping a fish is making sure that we visually inspect them everyday.
f5EGPzGSCJs_10 Simply follow directions and it tells you exactly how much to use, when you should do a water change.
f5EGPzGSCJs_11 Another thing that you can put in your tank is aquarium salt.
f5EGPzGSCJs_12 Aquarium salt raises the electrolytes in the tank and it also helps reduce stress.
f5EGPzGSCJs_13 My name is Michael and today we're talking about how to diagnose an ailment.
f5EGPzGSCJs_2 When we feed them we want to make sure that they have a good appetite and that their fins are not torn, they're not in rough shape, they're not sitting at the bottom.
f5EGPzGSCJs_3 Once you've been keeping your fish for a while, you're going to know if they're acting different.
f5EGPzGSCJs_4 A common problem with fish is Ick which is tiny white spots over the entire fish itself.
f5EGPzGSCJs_5 A lot of ailments are caused by stress which can be water quality, temperature and fish stressing out other fish themselves.
f5EGPzGSCJs_6 One thing that I like to start with if there is a regular ailment going on is using a natural product.
f5EGPzGSCJs_7_8_9 We have MELAFIX and PEMEFIX. MELAFIX is an anti-bacterial and PEMEFIX is an anti-fungal. What I like to do is use both of them together because its not an exact science of exactly what's going on with the fish so if there is a bacterial problem, we can take care of fungus as well if that happens to be part of the issue as well.
fE6xxSbjVV8_1 If there is clay on here, what happens is, as you come down here and you start taking the clay off the pot, see if I don't keep cleaning that tool off, all it does is keep going round and round and round.
fE6xxSbjVV8_10 Clean it off, you've got a lot of time.
fE6xxSbjVV8_11 So you have a nice smoothed out bottom down there.
fE6xxSbjVV8_12 That's it.
fE6xxSbjVV8_2 Sometimes it sticks to your pot, sometimes it doesn't.
fE6xxSbjVV8_3 So when you get clay on your tool, any tool for that matter, clean it off, set it aside.
fE6xxSbjVV8_4 So you start with a nice clean tool, so that as you take your tool, touch your piece, remember this is still kind of sticky, your clay trimmings don't transfer from your tool back onto your pot.
fE6xxSbjVV8_5 You're trying to get it off of your pot.
fE6xxSbjVV8_6 So we're going to come down in here again, clean some more of that off.
fE6xxSbjVV8_7 See how you have that all down there?
fE6xxSbjVV8_8 You have to clean this off.
fE6xxSbjVV8_9 Sometimes you just get little pieces of clay.
fslsm4MqBBE_0 Next we are going to be talking about the edge of a snowboard.
fslsm4MqBBE_1 The edge is this metal piece that wraps around the board completely depending on the type of board.
fslsm4MqBBE_2 Typically with the freestyle board it would have complete, wrap around, the free ride board would have a complete wrap around an all mountain board would have a complete wrap around but as you got to a jib and rail board that is where it might differ.
fslsm4MqBBE_3 On a jib and rail board towards the center of the board there would either be an indentation on the rail or no rail at all on the entire board.
fslsm4MqBBE_4 The only other exception to the rule is the Magne-Traction sidewall which is a seven tooth serrated edge that looks something like this on either side of the board and what that is to do is it is literally supposed to cut into ice.
fslsm4MqBBE_5 If you were to have a sidewall like this it might just shave off a nice top layer of it but with a serrated edge you can cut right into it and do better turns.
fux-zUwYX2Q_1 And now we're going to go over Fireball.
fux-zUwYX2Q_10 But, you've also got to realize that that X divided evenly, rounded down amongst the number of targets.
fux-zUwYX2Q_2 Fireball is a very long-standing staple of the red series of this game.
fux-zUwYX2Q_3 It is X and a red, much like Blaze.
fux-zUwYX2Q_4 However, Fireball is a little different.
fux-zUwYX2Q_5 Fireball is a Sorcery, but you may pay the X damage and have it deal to a single creature or play.
fux-zUwYX2Q_6 However, Fireball has the extra added thing that you may deal damage to multiple targets.
fux-zUwYX2Q_7 So you would divide that damage evenly among the targets, but you also have to pay one additional colorless Mana for each additional target.
fux-zUwYX2Q_8 So, if you were targeting two things you would have to pay one colorless and the red, and then you would start counting Mana for the X.
fux-zUwYX2Q_9 Likewise with two, three, and so forth.
fyI1Ev5m1w4_0_1 Ok. Now let's talk about turning the compost pile. Well, if it's all good, and you put this pile together right, you don't have to turn the compost pile.
fyI1Ev5m1w4_10 But we have plenty in the woods.
fyI1Ev5m1w4_11 You would add your leafy--your garden debris for aeration.
fyI1Ev5m1w4_12 And then you would start to turn your pile.
fyI1Ev5m1w4_13 You would take the top and you would put it on the bottom, just like this.
fyI1Ev5m1w4_2 Because, if you layered it right, and you watered it right, and you got your microorganisms in there, and you put the compost inoculate in there, you shouldn't have to turn this pile.
fyI1Ev5m1w4_3 Now, obviously, this is a brand new pile that we just made today.
fyI1Ev5m1w4_4 But, if for some reason your pile didn't cook down, which means if your pile is four feet high, when it's finished it should be about a foot and a half high.
fyI1Ev5m1w4_5 And it should cook down, and it should go down, and you should be able to see that it looks like compost, not like this material.
fyI1Ev5m1w4_6 But if you come across your pile, and it hasn't done those things, then you're going to want to turn your pile.
fyI1Ev5m1w4_7 The way we would do that is we would do just like we did in the beginning.
fyI1Ev5m1w4_8 We would put holes in the ground so it would drain good.
fyI1Ev5m1w4_9 We would create--add some more sticks, which we've run out of.
